To reach a king, one needs more than a sick guardian\n  and a mage with rotting face. At least, we need a wall of meat.\n<\/p>\n\n<h2>The Mark of the Changer<\/h2>\n\n<p>\n  [location:8770017]\n  smelled of old fish and failed ambitions. I found them in the town square:\n  three fishermen, their hands calloused by salt-worn ropes and their eyes\n  vacant with the aimless despair of the poor.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  For six hundred crowns,\n  [character:8769519],\u00a0[character:8769516]\u00a0and\n  [character:8769522]\n  agreed to put down their fishing nets for an adventure. I looked into their\n  mundane souls and felt the Raven stir. With a flick of my fingers, I bestowed\n  the Raven\u2019s Blessing upon two of them.<\/p><p><img data-gallery-id=\"a0f6e077-7074-4721-9b65-dafde2cb00d2\" alt=\"a0f6e077-7074-4721-9b65-dafde2cb00d2.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-ugc.kanka.io\/campaigns\/368255\/a0f6e077-7074-4721-9b65-dafde2cb00d2.jpg\"><br><\/p><p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  They felt it as a surge of unnatural vigor, a warmth in their veins they\n  mistook for hope. I knew it for what it truly was: a mark of durability, meant\n  only to keep the meat fresh longer for the butcher\u2019s blade.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  Why do they follow so easily? I wondered as we walk across town. Do they not\n  smell the ozone and grave-dust that clings to my robes? They are but\n  [race:8785922]\n  in the tide of my ascension. If they die, their souls will fuel my reach; if\n  they live, they are merely tools that haven't broken yet.\u00a0\n<\/p>\n<h2>Sellswords for Hire<\/h2>\n\n<p>\n  We will need better fights to aid me along the journey, and good fighters\n  cost. I led the group into the more polish part of the town, looking for jobs.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Our first task was a pittance from a local fool named Reinmar\u2014a man who spent\n  his time pouncing on birds while brigands made off with his \"enchanted\"\n  dagger.<\/p><p><img data-gallery-id=\"a0f6e0be-14ca-4252-a973-24209b25086c\" alt=\"a0f6e0be-14ca-4252-a973-24209b25086c.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-ugc.kanka.io\/campaigns\/368255\/a0f6e0be-14ca-4252-a973-24209b25086c.jpg\"><br><\/p><p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  We tracked the thieves to a clearing to the west.\n  [character:8690589]\u00a0remained by the wagons, her lungs still burning with alchemical fire. I\n  led the \"fish-fodder\" forward. The brigands laughed when they saw us\u2014a\n  green-skinned freak and three peasants smelling of brine.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  The combat was a symphony of chaos.\n  [character:8769522], his knuckles white upon a rusted pitchfork, stumbled in the mud\u2014a pathetic\n  display of mortal clumsiness. Yet, as the brigand leader lunged with the\n  stolen dagger, the Raven\u2019s Blessing held. He didn't just survive; he moved\n  with a sudden, supernatural clarity. His knife found the gap in the raider\u2019s\n  leather with the cold precision of a falling star.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  I watched from the rear, my fingers tracing the air as Abyssal energies coiled\n  around my staff like hungry vipers. The void provided. The brigands were\n  either gutted by our band of fodders, or evaporated by my spell\u00a0<i>twisted shock<\/i>, and the \"enchanted\" dagger was ours.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  Aside from the dagger in the brigands' camp, a heavy, iron-bound crate sat\n  amongst the spoils. When we pried it open, expecting relics of the Ancient\n  Empire, we were met with a curse of a different sort. A brass-fitted\n  contraption began to spin, emitting a looping, spectral tune.\n<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n  <i>\ud83c\udfb5<\/i><i>Never gonna give you up....\u00a0<\/i><i>\ud83c\udfb5\u00a0<\/i><i>never gonna let you down...<\/i>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>\n  A multidimensional mockery, humming a synth-pop melody so annoyingly catchy it\n  threatened to unravel the grimness of my crusade.\u00a0<\/p><p><img data-gallery-id=\"a0f6e142-3c34-4996-8f15-fc5c950c6d50\" alt=\"a0f6e142-3c34-4996-8f15-fc5c950c6d50.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-ugc.kanka.io\/campaigns\/368255\/a0f6e142-3c34-4996-8f15-fc5c950c6d50.jpg\"><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight:bolder;color:rgb(200,202,208);\">We have been rickrolled<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(200,202,208);\">.

He\n  offered us another job to deliver a mysterious chest to a noble named Eike in\n  the town of[location:8770271]. I agreed to take to quest.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  We marched east, first stopping by\u00a0[location:8770270].\u00a0The air growing thick with coal smoke and the metallic tang of hot\n  iron. The road was a grueling slog;\n  [character:8769519]\u00a0was already showing the weariness of a soul tethered to a dark master.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  In the dead of night, the town\u2019s back alleys twisted like gutted snakes. We\n  sought an alchemist, but found an anatomist instead\u2014a figure in a beaked mask\n  whose den reeked of preserving salts and vinegar.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  \"Knowledge demands sacrifice,\" the butcher whispered, his glass lenses\n  reflecting my purple eyes. \"Flesh for flesh.\"\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  I did not hesitate. The path to the Usurper requires components that cannot be\n  pried from common merchants. We cut straws, but the Abyss already knew its\n  victim. Bardol drew the short one. I watched with a cold, detached curiosity\n  as he was strapped to an iron-framed table.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  For three hours, the screams echoed behind the blackened door. When he\n  emerged, he was a broken thing, stiff and hollow-eyed, but he clutched a glass\n  phial in his trembling hand: an Unhold\u2019s Heart, still pulsing with a faint,\n  regenerative rhythm.<\/p><p><img data-gallery-id=\"a0f6e1a8-9ce8-434a-a71c-9dcf519c531f\" alt=\"a0f6e1a8-9ce8-434a-a71c-9dcf519c531f.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-ugc.kanka.io\/campaigns\/368255\/a0f6e1a8-9ce8-434a-a71c-9dcf519c531f.jpg\"><\/p><p>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  I can feel their resentment simmering beneath the surface, I mused, watching\n  the other fishermen eye me with newfound terror. They realize now that they\n  are not my brothers, but my reagents. Let them fear. Fear is a far more\n  reliable tether than gold. Bardol\u2019s agony is the price of our progress. If I\n  am to unseat a god-king, I cannot afford the luxury of a conscience.\n<\/p>\n<h2>An Important Night of Rest<\/h2>\n<p>\n  We camped outside of town to rest up. Although I need no such thing called\n  <i>rest<\/i>, my fodders need to be in shape to be effective meat shield. While\n  they enjoy the weight of the few crows for their first day of service, I spent\n  the night tending to the illness of\n  [character:8690589].\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  By Day 2, the mutation had finally taken its full hold of\n  [character:8690589]. She emerged from her fever no longer an ordinary shield maiden, but a\n  [race:8694294]. Her eyes were yellow, slitted like a cat\u2019s. Although still ill, she began\n  to move with a predatory grace that silenced even the ravens.\u00a0\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  We walked towards the next town along the road,\u00a0[location:8770271]. On the way there, we chanced upon a few nomads moving to jump on a Southern\n  caravan. I ordered the charge.\u00a0We left the sands red and the Southerners\n  in our debt.\n<\/p>\n<h2>Corrupted Local Nobles<\/h2>\n\n<p>\n  We reached Thal at midday, delivering the chest to the local noble Eike. He\n  treated us with the disdain of a man who hasn't yet realized the world is\n  ending. But it was the next contract that revealed the true rot. Another local\n  noble named Frank complained of \"unruly vagabonds\" destroying his wheat\n  fields.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  When we arrived, there were no men. There was only a manifestation of runaway\n  life. Vines painted the buildings in a verdant crawl; grass grew in the pig\n  pens; and in the cemetery, blue birds bathed in open graves where the dead had\n  been displaced by the rising earth. NeCola's medallion hummed like a hornet\u2019s\n  nest against her chest. This was no bandit raid; it was a primal, unnatural\n  surge.<\/p><p><img data-gallery-id=\"a0f6e2d6-baaf-4e53-8282-a7f08e13fae1\" alt=\"a0f6e2d6-baaf-4e53-8282-a7f08e13fae1.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-ugc.kanka.io\/campaigns\/368255\/a0f6e2d6-baaf-4e53-8282-a7f08e13fae1.jpg\"><\/p><p>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  <em>The earth itself is restless,<\/em> I thought as I watched a vine slowly\n  crush the stone of a farmhouse.\n  <em>Is this the Usurper\u2019s work, or is the world simply reacting to the\n    Changer\u2019s arrival? Frank wants his wheat, but he is blind to the fact that\n    the soil no longer belongs to him. We will take his crowns and leave him to\n    his vines. There are larger graves to dig.<\/em>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  We escorted his workers to clean up the field, staying only long enough to\n  secure the 220 crowns promised. I watched the laborers begin their futile\n  repairs, knowing they were little more than compost for the coming storm.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  As Day 2 drew to a close, we sat by the fire, the Unhold\u2019s Heart thumping in\n  my pack and the gold clinking in my purse. NeCola sat awake, her yellow eyes\n  tracking the darkness. We have survived the brine and the blood of our first\n  days, but the Usurper's shadow is lengthening. And the Raven is always hungry.\n<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<hr>\n<p><\/p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-centered\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <span style=\"color:rgb(200,202,208);text-align:right;\">\u2b05\ufe0f Return to\u00a0<\/span>[journal:8694710]\n      <\/td>\n      <td>||<\/td>\n      <td>\n        <p style=\"text-align:right;\">\n          Read next [journal:8786890]\u27a1\ufe0f\n        <\/p>\n      <\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n<\/table>","is_private":0,"tooltip":null,"is_template":null,"is_attributes_private":0,"focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"created_at":"2026-01-29T10:22:28.000000Z","updated_at":"2026-02-02T05:55:44.000000Z","created_by":365072,"updated_by":365072,"image_path":null,"image_uuid":null,"header_image":null,"header_uuid":null,"marketplace_uuid":null,"reminders":[{"id":331752,"calendar_id":31926,"length":3,"comment":null,"is_recurring":0,"recurring_until":null,"recurring_periodicity":null,"colour":"#cccccc","day":1,"month":1,"year":1,"type_id":4,"visibility_id":1,"created_by":365072}],"mentions":[{"entity_id":8786747,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8690587},{"entity_id":8786747,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8690589},{"entity_id":8786747,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8770017},{"entity_id":8786747,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8694462},{"entity_id":8786747,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8694294},{"entity_id":8786747,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8690588},{"entity_id":8786747,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8690591},{"entity_id":8786747,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8769519},{"entity_id":8786747,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8769516},{"entity_id":8786747,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8769522},{"entity_id":8786747,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8785922},{"entity_id":8786747,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8770271},{"entity_id":8786747,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8770270},{"entity_id":8786747,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8694710},{"entity_id":8786747,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8786890}]}}
