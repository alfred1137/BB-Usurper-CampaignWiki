We had survived the North\u2019s bite and the screams of the Geists, but the cost was etched into the jagged scars and hollow eyes of my men. I stood amidst the gloom, feeling the Abyssal energy within me coil restlessly. My company was a collection of the broken men held together by the Raven\u2019s Blessing and my own iron will. Yet, as I looked at the mangled trio of fishermen and the zombified remains of Evett, I knew that for the journey ahead, I needed more than just durable meat. I needed a legend.<\/span><\/p>\n\n    <p>The pursuit of the Usurper King is a heavy burden, one that requires a detachment from pity and mercy. I find myself staring at the fishermen, convinced that the Raven\u2019s laughter is the only thing keeping them upright. Is this my destiny? To lead a parade of corpses through the mud of the world? I am the last son of a noble house, a scholar of the forbidden, yet I spend my days bartering for souls in a town that smells of wet wool and despair. The Usurper sits on his throne, but he is a shadow compared to the void I am prepared to unleash. If I must fill my roster with ghosts to reach him, then the graveyard will be my recruitment hall.<\/p>\n\n    <h2>The spectral vanguard and the carrion feast<\/h2>\n    <p>In the heart of Ravens' Town, I found him. [character:8779123]\u00a0<span style=\"background-color:unset;color:rgb(200,202,208);\">was a memory, clad in the iron of a previous life\u2014an Ancestral Vatt'ghern whose singular ambition was such that the Azure Lord could not claim his soul for the afterlife. He was a spectral entity of blue and cyan light, his presence causing the air to crackle with frost. I paid <\/span><strong>five thousand crowns<\/strong><span style=\"background-color:unset;color:rgb(200,202,208);\"> for his compact\u2014a king\u2019s ransom for a ghost. The townspeople crossed themselves as we departed. Wilfried\u2019s spectral boots made no sound on the cobblestones, a sharp contrast to the wet, rhythmic thumping of my undead thrall, <\/span><strong>Arnulf<\/strong><span style=\"background-color:unset;color:rgb(200,202,208);\">.<\/span><\/p>\n\n    <p>The road leading south toward Stohl was quickly interrupted by the stench of rot. A pack of Nachzehrers\u2014vile eaters of remains\u2014lunged from the brush, their distended bellies dragging in the dirt. I didn't even bother to raise my staff. <strong>NeCola<\/strong> moved with indifference, her slitted eyes tracking the ghouls. The fight was a surgical slaughter that lasted mere seconds. <strong>Bardol<\/strong>, the thrice-struck fisherman, fought with supernatural clarity, his spear finding the throat of a beast with precision impossible for a man with his injuries. However, the victory was soured; Arnulf, my tireless zombie, was caught in a frenzied mauling that left him shredded. I watched him shamble back into line, his undead flesh weeping black ichor.<\/p>\n\n    <p>This world is sustained by consuming the remains of its failures. We eat the remains of our enemies to grow stronger; we loot the dead to pay for the living. I recruited a refugee named <strong>Dauid<\/strong> on the march\u2014a man who had seen his village burned to ash and had nothing left but his skin. I saw the fear in his eyes when he looked at Wilfried, but he joined nonetheless. He is another vessel, another piece of fodder to be thrown into the gears of my conquest. I wonder if he realizes that his \u2018survival\u2019 is merely a temporary lease granted by my curiosity.<\/p>\n\n    <h2>The burning sands of Ka-Sabar<\/h2>\n    <p>By the midday of Day 13, the biting winds of the North were a distant memory, replaced by the salt-heavy, sweltering heat of the Southern City-States. We had paid the gold to sail across the sea, trading the mud of Stohl for the shimmering, deceptive sands of Ka-Sabar. The sudden change felt brutal. The Gilder-worshipping southerners looked at my green skin and spectral warriors with dread and suspicion. Ka-Sabar itself was a disappointment; the economy was stagnant, and the Viziers were too busy counting their gold to offer a contract worthy of the Usurper's Bane.<\/p>\n\n    <p>We pushed onward toward Ras Karim, the sun a relentless hammer beating down on the armor of my men. The heat was an enemy we could not strike. I watched as Dauid and the other fodder struggled, their breath coming in ragged gasps. I grew cold with annoyance. These men were becoming soft under the gaze of the Gilder. To break the dull monotony, I found a target in the dunes: a lone hyena, a scavenger that had been tailing us for miles. I ordered the company to halt. I wanted entertainment, a distraction.<\/p>\n\n    <p>\"Dance for me,\" I commanded, gesturing toward the beast. \"Let us see how many bites the 'blessed' can dodge before the sand drinks.\" It was a cruel whim, perhaps, but a Mage must occasionally test the limits of his tools. The hyena was a blur of tan fur and snapping jaws. I expected a quick execution, but the desert has a way of humbling the arrogant. The beast moved with a speed that defied its size, its teeth finding the gaps in the men's concentration. The \"dance\" was a bloody massacre of the weak, a testament to the fragility of those who rely on luck rather than skill.<\/p>\n\n    <h2>The butcher's bill in the dunes<\/h2>\n    <p>The fight lasted five agonizing rounds. What I had intended as training became a charnel house. Arnulf, the faithful zombie who had survived the Northern Champion and the Geists, was finally undone. The hyena\u2019s jaws closed around his throat, and for the first time, the zombie did not rise. Evett the Rabbit, another of my zombified vanguard, was shredded into unrecognisable ribbons of meat. They met their final death in the most ignoble of ways\u2014at the teeth of a common scavenger. Bardol, Dauid, and Jan the Bright were struck down, their bodies a collection of fresh, permanent injuries that would haunt them for the rest of their short lives.<\/p>\n\n    <p>The carnage left me hollow, not for the men, but for the waste of resources. Arnulf had been a reliable anvil, a tireless wall of meat that required no food. To lose him to a hyena felt like a personal insult from the Raven. I look at the survivors, Bardol and the others, and I see the marks of the desert. They are \"injury collectors\" now, barely held together by bandages and the lingering traces of my magic. The Usurper King\u2019s shadow looms larger as my frontline crumbles into the sand.<\/p>\n\n    <p>We looted the bodies of our own brothers, stripping the rusted mail and bloodied leather from the remains of Arnulf and Evett. \"Leave the dead to the birds,\" I ordered, my voice as dry as the dunes. We left them for the crows and the vultures, a grim offering to the desert that had already taken so much. NeCola and Wilfried stood by in silence, their eyes fixed on the horizon where the spires of Ras Karim flickered like a mirage. They are the only pillars of strength left in a line that is rapidly becoming a collection of cripples.<\/p>\n\n    <h2>Resolution and the road to Ras Karim<\/h2>\n    <p>The desert is a cruel mistress, and she has already begun to prune the weak. We are a leaner company now, stripped of our illusions and our most durable thralls. We limp toward Ras Karim, a parade of the maimed led by a Mage who has forgotten the meaning of mercy. The <strong>10,000 crowns<\/strong> in my purse feel heavier now, a weight that reminds me of the cost of every victory and the inevitable price of my ultimate goal.<\/p>\n\n    <p>The Usurper is waiting, but the desert was the first wall I had to breach. I look at Dauid, the survivor who is now a broken man, and I wonder who will be the next to feed the birds. The Raven God is laughing, I can hear it in the wind that howls across the dunes. Next, we shall enter the Arena of Ras Karim, where blood is the only currency that matters. Will my \"injury collectors\" find glory in the pits, or will the desert finish what the hyena started?<\/p>\n\n    <hr>\n\n    <h2>Session Wrap<\/h2><ul style=\"color:rgb(200,202,208);\"><li>The company has transitioned from the North to the Southern City-States via Stohl.<\/li><li>Heavy investment in Wilfried (5,000 crowns) and travel (360 crowns).<\/li><li>The loss of two zombified frontliners has significantly weakened the company's defensive capabilities.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n    <h3>Encounters:<\/h3>\n    <ul>\n        <li><strong>The Ravens' Town Pact:<\/strong> Recruited Wilfried, an Ancestral Vatt'ghern spectral entity.<\/li>\n        <li><strong>The Nachzehrer Harvest:<\/strong> A 3-round victory outside Ravens' Town.

As we marched toward [location:8779128] on the afternoon of Day 13, the sun felt like a physical weight upon my green-tinged brow, a relentless eye of the Gilder that seemed intent on bleaching the very magic from my marrow. Behind me, my company\u2014the Usurper\u2019s Bane\u2014trudged through the shifting dunes, their boots kicking up a fine, stinging dust that tasted of salt and ancient remains. We had traded the mud of Stohl for this shimmering hellscape, and already the land had begun to prune the weak. Arnulf and Evett were gone, left to the scavengers, and my remaining frontline was little more than a collection of walking scars and bitter resentment.<\/p>\n\n    <p>I often contemplate the nature of the 'fodder' I gather. To the Gilder-worshippers of these lands, life is a debt to be paid in service or blood, but to me, it is merely the insulation between my will and the blades of the world. I watched Bardol F, a man who had been struck down more times than a tavern rug, and I felt a simmering irritation. Why does the Raven cling so tightly to such a broken vessel? Is there a grand design in his continued breathing, or is the Changer simply mocking my desire for a more efficient, undead vanguard? The desert provides a clarity that the damp forests of the North lack; here, you are either water or dust, and I am weary of leading men who insist on remains as the former when they have long since earned the status of the latter.<\/p>\n\n    <h2>The manhunter\u2019s tithe and the gilded gates<\/h2>\n\n    <p>On the morning of Day 14, as the white spires of Ras Karim flickered like a mirage on the horizon, we encountered a grim procession. A line of men in heavy iron chains was being driven through the sand by a manhunter whose ivory teeth flashed in a predatory grin. He claimed they were 'Indebted'\u2014souls paying for the sins of their ancestors\u2014but a voice cried out from the ranks, a sharp Northern accent that cut through the humid air. It was a sailor, a man named Frethold, who claimed he was no slave but a mariner captured by pirates. Bardol, with a moment of supernatural recognition that could only be a twist of the Raven\u2019s own hand, identified the man as a former shipmate from winters past.<\/p>\n\n    <p>The manhunter, perhaps sensing the Abyssal aura radiating from my form or seeing the yellow, predatory eyes of NeCola shifting beneath her hood, chose the path of least resistance. He released Frethold, claiming the Gilder had ordained this meeting. I saw it differently: I saw a fresh body to replace the meat we had lost to the hyenas. Frethold joined our ranks, salt-crusted and sun-scorched, another fisherman destined to find the Abyss in the middle of a wasteland. We entered the gates of Ras Karim shortly after, the air thick with the smell of roasting meats, exotic spices, and the copper tang of the nearby Arena.<\/p>\n\n    <p>We had struck gold in this den of merchants; the sell prices were a tribute to the desperation of the South. But it was the Arena that called to me\u2014a place where the transition from life to death is a spectator sport. I set our ambition: five victories in the pits to prove that the Usurper\u2019s Bane was a name to be feared even in these gilded lands.<\/p>\n\n    <h2>The blood-stained sands of the Arena<\/h2>\n\n    <p>Our first bout was against two desert nomads for a purse of over fifteen hundred crowns. I stepped onto the hot sand alongside NeCola and the seemingly immortal Bardol. NeCola moved with a grace that transcended human limits, her Vatt'ghern mutations allowing her to weave through the nomads' scimitars as if she were a ghost dancing in the wind. She dispatched them with a cold efficiency that left the crowd in a stunned silence before they erupted in a roar of bloodlust. Bardol, true to his curse, held the line with a frantic, desperate effort, absorbing a blow that would have decapitated a lesser man. He was struck down, his blood painting the sand, yet he refused to yield his final breath.<\/p>\n\n    <p>The second match was a pit of serpents. Three great snakes coiled and hissed, their venomous fangs glinting in the sun. It was an easy slaughter for NeCola, who severed their heads before they could strike, while Bardol once again acted as the target, surviving yet another mauling that defied the laws of anatomy. By the third match, another trio of nomads, I found myself whispering to the fisherman as we entered the gate: \"Bardol, try not to survive this one, yes?\". But the Raven is a fickle god; the nomads broke against us, and Bardol was dragged from the arena floor, mangled and unconscious, yet still stubbornly, irritatingly alive.<\/p>\n\n    <p>Before leaving the city, I recruited Abanoub Ibn Mansur, a man born into debt whose primary allegiance was to a freedom he had never tasted. He was an investment in pure potential\u2014and a salary-free one at that. I looked at him and saw a man who would either find his liberty or his grave under my banner, and I cared little which came first. We departed Ras Karim toward Makan Muqadas, the holy city, but the desert had one final, cruel joke to play on our journey.<\/p>\n\n    <h2>The necromancer\u2019s harvest: a final farewell<\/h2>\n\n    <p>The march to [location:8779129]<span style=\"background-color:unset;color:rgb(200,202,208);\">\u00a0was interrupted by the stench of old rot that even the sun could not burn away. A Necromancer, flanked by a Fallen Hero in rusted plate and an Embalmed Slave, blocked our path. This was no arena show; this was a struggle for the very souls of my company. The fight lasted seven rounds of absolute carnage. NeCola was a vision of death, her silver blade dealing a staggering amount of damage as she kept the Fallen Hero occupied, her signs crackling in the dry air. I unleashed the Abyssal energies I had been nurturing, my Twisted Shock arcing through the air to wither the Necromancer\u2019s focus.<\/span><\/p>\n\n    <p>But the cost was the end of an era. The \"Immortals\" of my frontline\u2014the men who had survived the Northern wastes and the Geist's scream\u2014finally reached their limit. Frethold, the sailor we had just rescued, was the first to fall. Then Jan the Bright, whose luck finally ran dry in a spray of gore. And finally, Bardol F, the man who had cheated death a dozen times, was torn apart by the Embalmed Slave. I watched them fall, and for a moment, the desert was silent save for the buzzing of flies. Wilfried B, my spectral warrior, stood over the bodies and asked what should be done. I did not hesitate. \"Loot the bodies,\" I commanded, my voice like the dry wind. \"Leave the dead to the birds\".<\/p>\n\n    <p>We reached the gates of Makan Muqadas by mid-day on Day 15. We had entered the desert as a company of survivors; we entered the holy city as a company of killers, stripped of our dead weight and our illusions. The Usurper\u2019s shadow is close now, and while the Gilder\u2019s followers pray for salvation, I am preparing to show them that in the Abyss, there is no such thing as debt\u2014only the finality of the grave.<\/p>\n\n    <hr>\n\n    <h2>Session wrap<\/h2>\n\n    <p>The journey saw several key encounters: we claimed the sailor Frethold from a Southern slaver; secured three of the five arena victories necessary for my current ambition in Ras Karim; and were ambushed by a Necromancer\u2019s company, which, despite our victory, collapsed our entire old frontline. We even assisted the city-state scouts against an Icy Golem and Possessed Raiders outside Makan Muqadas itself.<\/p>\n    <p><strong>NeCola<\/strong>, the Vatt'ghern, was dominant across every engagement, single-handedly carrying the offense. <strong>HiYun<\/strong>, my Abyssal Mage, secured a kill against the Necromancer's core and provided vital ranged support. <strong>Abanoub Ibn Mansur<\/strong> survived his debut despite taking a brutal beating that nearly ended him early.<\/p>\n    <p>The heavy cost was paid by the veterans, the so-called \"Immortals.\" [character:8779130], [character:8770306]\u00a0the bright, and finally [character:8769516]were all killed in action. Their deaths have stripped the roster of fodder, leaving a lean core of high-talent fighters (NeCola, Wilfried, HiYun). But the treasury has seen significant growth from arena payouts and successful trade in Ras Karim, proving the risks were worthwhile.<\/p>\n\n    <p><span style=\"background-color:unset;color:rgb(200,202,208);\">With the \"Immortals\" dead and our pockets full of Gilder gold, we stand at the heart of Southern faith in Makan Muqadas. The ambition is three-fifths complete, and the company is gaining serious notoriety in these lands. But as the dead rise in the dunes and the possessed wander the outskirts, I wonder: did the Raven allow my veterans to die to make room for something far more monstrous?<\/span><\/p>","entity_id":8694710,"created_by":365072,"created_at":"2026-01-28T05:27:19.000000Z","updated_at":"2026-01-29T03:34:37.000000Z","visibility_id":2,"updated_by":365072,"is_pinned":0,"position":6,"settings":{"collapsed":"0"},"marketplace_uuid":null,"location_id":null,"layout_id":null,"deleted_at":null,"deleted_by":null,"is_template":0,"words":1486},{"id":1114216,"name":"Gilded Pits and Forsaken's Toll (Session 6)","entry":"<h1>Blood-soaked Sand around Makan Muqadas<\/h1>\n\n    <p>The white domes of Makan Muqadas\u2014a holy city that felt more like a tomb to my Northern sensibilities\u2014shimmered under the Gilder\u2019s sun like the bleached skulls of giants. We had left the remains of Bardol and Jan to the carrion birds, their boasted \"immortality\" proving only a temporary delay to the Raven\u2019s hunger. I stood at the threshold of the Great Arena, the air thick with the cloying scent of frankincense, roasted meats, and the copper tang of fresh blood. My company, the Usurper's Bane, was now a lean, predatory thing\u2014a collection of spectral remnants and mutated killers bound by my Abyssal will. We had three victories in the pits already; ambition demanded two more, and the desert was eager to provide the victims.<\/p>\n\n    <p>I looked at the white domes of Makan Muqadas and felt nothing but the hollow chill of the Raven\u2019s gaze. I told myself the loss of Bardol and the others was not a tragedy, but merely a necessary subtraction of inefficient parts from a grand machine. Yet, a nagging sensation persists, a sliver of the monk I was meant to be, whispering that I am becoming the very disaster I was sent to stop. Does the Changer care for the blood we spill, or is the Usurper merely a reflection of my own descent? My noble lineage is a dust-choked memory now, replaced by the copper tang of desert air and the sight of my men becoming monsters. I wonder if the Azure Lord mocks me, or if the \"Indebted\" like Abanoub are the only ones truly free in this world. They owe only their lives; I owe my soul to a void that never stops screaming for more. To build a legend, one must first bury the man.<\/p>\n\n    <h2>The Sand\u2019s Final Tithe<\/h2>\n\n    <p>The heat was a physical weight, a hammer-blow from the Gilder that made the air wobble over the arena floor. Our fourth bout was a grizzly affair against a pair of Southern Gladiators, men who moved with the grace of scorpions and the arrogance of kings. I watched from the rear, my green-tinged fingers weaving the threads of the Abyss into a Twisted Shock that arced across the sand. NeCola, her yellow Vatt'ghern eyes focused, moved with unnatural clarity, her blade finding the gap in a gladiator\u2019s mail with the precision of a surgeon. The crowd roared, a sound like crashing waves, as the man slumped into the dust, his blood instantly boiling in the midday heat.<\/p>\n\n    <p>The final match was a necessary test of iron and resolve. We faced three desert nomads, their faces masked by indigo veils, their movements synchronized and deadly. Abanoub, the Indebted who sought freedom in the spray of gore, held the center. He fought with frantic energy, his shield absorbing blows that should have shattered a lesser man\u2019s arm. Wilfried B, our spectral Ancestral Vatt'ghern, stood beside him\u2014a pale blue light in the shimmering haze that seemed to ignore the heat entirely. He struck with his spectral edge, the nomads\u2019 steel passing through him as if he were nothing but a bad memory. When the last nomad fell, the circuit was ours. We were no longer just mercenaries; we were the undisputed masters of Ras Karim.<\/p>\n\n    <p>As we gathered our spoils, a new figure approached the company under the flickering torchlight of the city gates\u2014a creature that made even the battle-hardened Conscripts recoil. He was an Arachnid Warped Warrior, his skin covered in a hard, chitinous shell that pulsed with an unnatural life. He claimed to have been \"changed\" by the same void that answered my call, his funnel-web eyes reflecting a vision that saw humans only as prey. I welcomed him into the Bane. In this world of rising dead and demon lords, a man with the sting of a redback is a tool I cannot afford to ignore.<\/p>\n\n    <h2>The Siege of the Ruined Gate<\/h2>\n\n    <p>We departed Makan Muqadas on Day 16, heading back toward the northern wastes where the Usurper\u2019s shadow grew longest. The journey was a grueling march across the brutal desert, where every oasis felt like a trap and every vulture felt like a spy. By Day 17, the terrain shifted into a jagged wasteland of cracked earth and dry scrub. It was here that we encountered the first true proof of our progress: The Forsaken. These were not mere bandits; they were heavy-armored monstrosities, mutated to the point of total insanity, their humanity lost to the very warp I sought to command.<\/p>\n\n    <p>The scouts signaled a halt. Ahead, near a ruined caravanserai, a Forsaken Champion stood amidst a pile of slaughtered merchants. He was a hulking brute, his armor fused to his skin by pulsating, night-black veins\u2014the tell-tale mark of a demon-cursed weapon. Around him stood his minions, men whose bodies had sprouted extra limbs or hardened into bone-crusted shells. The air around them crackled with the same Abyssal Fire I had used to stabilize NeCola. This was the Usurper\u2019s rising power made flesh, a challenge meant to break us.<\/p>\n\n    <p>I felt the men hesitate. Even Wilfried's spectral glow seemed to dim in the presence of such raw, mutated malice. I stepped to the front of the line, my staff thumping against the parched earth. \"They are but meat,\" I snarled, the Raven's voice echoing in the hollows of my skull. \"And we are the butcher.\" I channeled the Abyss, my Sign Intensity surging as I prepared to unleash the forbidden magic of the Vatt'ghern. The Forsaken leader let out a roar that was more animal than man, his mutated lungs pushing out a cloud of foul, necrotizing steam as he charged.<\/p>\n\n    <h2>The Ruined Gate<\/h2>\n\n    <p>The combat was swift and vicious. NeCola opened the fight by casting the Yrden sign; purple glyphs flared on the ground, trapping the Forsaken in a field of sluggish time that hampered their mutated speed. The Forsaken Champion, however, ignored the trap, his demon-cursed axe descending in a vertical arc. Abanoub raised his shield, but the strike was so overwhelming he fumbled the defense, his boots slipping in the dry sand as he fell backward in an embarrassing sprawl. The Champion raised his weapon for the killing blow, but I intervened, casting a Raven Bolt of Change that ignored his heavy plate and sizzled through his mutated heart.<\/p>\n\n    <p>Wilfried B took advantage of the opening, his spectral blades weaving through the gaps in the Forsaken's iron skin. He moved with supernatural clarity, guided by the Azure Lord toward the enemy's softest corruption. Beside him, our new Arachnid recruit unleashed his Redback Sting, injecting a corrosive venom into the Forsaken's open wounds. The mutated warriors fought with mindless rage, their dark power letting them absorb far more punishment than they deserved, but they were no match for the combined might of our Vatt'ghern signs and Abyssal shocks.<\/p>\n\n    <p>The climax arrived when NeCola unleashed the Bront sign. Chain lightning erupted from her fingertips, jumping from the Champion to his mutated retinue in a blinding flash of blue-white energy that ignored their armor entirely. The Forsaken broke. Their iron will shattered under the weight of the Azure Lord's wrath. The Champion was the last to fall, his body dissolving into a puddle of black ichor and mutated reagents that hissed against the desert sand. We stood victorious amidst the ruin, the silence of the desert returning as the last of the lightning faded.<\/p>\n\n    <h2>The Butcher\u2019s Resolve<\/h2>\n\n    <p>We gathered the remains\u2014the special mutagens and demon-stained steel that would be the foundation for our next transformation. The Forsaken Champion\u2019s head was a trophy that would earn us a king's ransom in the North, but the true prize was realizing the Usurper's influence was spreading faster than my texts had predicted. We had survived the long road through the South, but the path back to the Raven\u2019s Watch would be paved with the bodies of those who dared to stand in the path of the Changer.<\/p>\n\n    <p>As we marched away from the ruined caravanserai, the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the desert in the bruised purples and blacks of our own banner. My company was battered, our armor dented and our spirits frayed, but we were evolving. I looked at Abanoub, nursing a bruised shoulder, and at the Arachnid Warrior, cleaning his mandibles with indifferent efficiency. We were becoming the very nightmare the world feared\u2014a gathering of the maimed and the mutated, marching under the mandate of a god of void. The Usurper King sits on his obsidian throne, but he does not see the wave of carrion-flies I am bringing to his gates.<\/p>\n\n    <hr>\n\n    <h3><strong>Session Wrap<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n    <p>The week concluded with the successful completion of the five required arena fights in Makan Muqadas, solidifying our reputation and netting significant coin. More importantly, we recruited the Arachnid Warped Warrior, bringing a potent new source of poison and chitinous defense to the Bane.<\/p>\n\n    <p>The true test came in the deep desert when we faced The Forsaken. These heavy-armored foes confirmed that the \"Demonic Chaos\" curse is spreading rapidly beyond the Northern Barbarians. The fighting was fierce. NeCola's new Tier 3 Offense Signs proved devastating, scoring several kills through massive area-of-effect damage. Wilfried B performed flawlessly, sustaining zero damage while acting as our spectral anchor. My own Abyssal Shocks were essential for bypassing the Champion\u2019s heavily fused armor, though Abanoub suffered a critical strike early on, taking heavy damage before I could intervene.<\/p>\n\n    <p>We are now wealthy enough to return to the North and purchase new, high-grade equipment. However, as we crest the dunes heading north, the Vatt'ghern Medallion doesn't just hum\u2014it screams. Something massive is moving in the shifting sands, a creature\u2014perhaps a Flesh Golem or a Lindwurm\u2014drawn by the potent scent of our lightning. We have gained new power, but this power has finally caught the eye of something far larger than the Forsaken.<\/p>\n\n    <hr>\n\n","entity_id":8694710,"created_by":365072,"created_at":"2026-01-28T08:57:10.000000Z","updated_at":"2026-01-29T03:34:43.000000Z","visibility_id":2,"updated_by":365072,"is_pinned":0,"position":7,"settings":{"collapsed":"0"},"marketplace_uuid":null,"location_id":null,"layout_id":null,"deleted_at":null,"deleted_by":null,"is_template":0,"words":1665}],"mentions":[{"entity_id":8694710,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8690587},{"entity_id":8694710,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8690588},{"entity_id":8694710,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8690589},{"entity_id":8694710,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8690590},{"entity_id":8694710,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8690591},{"entity_id":8694710,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":1113278,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8690589},{"entity_id":8694710,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":1113278,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8690591},{"entity_id":8694710,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":1113332,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8690589},{"entity_id":8694710,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":1101812,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8786745},{"entity_id":8694710,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":1101812,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8786747}]}}
