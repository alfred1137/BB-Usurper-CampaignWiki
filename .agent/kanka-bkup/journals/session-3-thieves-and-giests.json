We found ourselves standing in its town square after taking a delivery request from [location:8770272]. It was a simple job that pays so I have nothing to complain about.<\/p>\n\n        <h2 style=\"color:rgb(200,202,208);\">Raising the Company Banner<\/h2><p style=\"color:rgb(200,202,208);\">While on the way to [location:8770273],\u00a0[character:8770307]\u00a0suggested that I raise a company banner to formalise the company.\u00a0<i>\"It's a decent idea,\"<\/i>\u00a0I said,\u00a0<i>\"but who's to make it?\"<\/i>\u00a0Little do I know that this flagellant is skilled at sewing things together.

It felt more like a burial cloth than a mercenary standard. <i>Was she making fun of my rotting green face<\/i>, I can't help but wonder.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p style=\"color:rgb(200,202,208);\">===PLACEHOLDER: Banner===<\/p>\n\n    <h2>The Swordmaster\u2019s failure\u00a0<\/h2>\n\n    <p>Since there weren't much going on in [location:8770273], we headed east toward [location:8770275]. The road was monotonous drudgery\u2014boots churning mud, nothing more. We stopped briefly at [location:8770274], a fortress of cold stone where the air smelled of wet wool and old iron, but the world felt stagnant there. It wasn't until we reached the thatched roofs of [location:8770275]\u00a0on Day 9 that the Changer provided a new piece for my board.<\/p>\n\n    <p>In a dimly lit paddock, I found [character:8770306], an \u2018Apprentice\u2019\u2014a failed student of a swordmaster, lacking the grace for traditional forms, yet possessing a desperate, frantic effort that I found useful. I bought his contract from his old master with the same indifference I\u2019d use to buy a mule. He earned himself the nickname \u2018The Bright\u2019 when he was younger, they said. To me, he was simply another vessel to soak up the steel that might otherwise find my own throat.<\/p>\n\n        <p>I watched [character:8770306] handle his buckler with white-knuckled terror, his eyes wide as he looked at the silent, shambling zombie [character:8769519]. The man thinks effort will save him. He does not yet understand that in this company, effort is merely the oil that keeps the meat-grinder turning.\u00a0<\/p><h2><span style=\"font-size:28.8px;\">The Book of Bloodlines<\/span><\/h2>\n\n    <p>In [location:8770275], our first job was simple: retrieve an Antique Book of Bloodlines. A desperate mob of bandit rabble had stolen it, hiding out north of town. We found them in a clearing\u2014sixteen wretched souls huddled in rags, clutching rusted knives and sharpened sticks as if they could stop the tide. I ordered the line forward, pushing the \u2018Bright\u2019 apprentice into the centre.<\/p>\n\n    <p>The fight was a surgical slaughter that lasted only minutes. [character:8690589]\u00a0moved with preternatural speed, her spear a blur, opening throats before the bandits could even scream. Even [character:8770306] managed to spill blood, though a bandit\u2019s jagged blade opened a red furrow across his ribs\u2014a first lesson in the price of my employment. Scarcely had we finished the butchery when another ten rabble emerged from the trees, perhaps hoping to scavenge. We used them as training dummies, NeCola dancing through their ranks while the rest of the company played catch-up.<\/p><p>Once we returned the book to its rightful owner back in town, I went looking for new quest. We need more challenges than some rebels.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n    <h2>Screams in the drafty shack<\/h2>\n\n    <p>The dread thickened when Garcia the Steward called us into his office. He spoke of missing miners and screams at an old quarry south-east of the village, but I saw the truth in the way shadows clung to the corners of the room. He offered a king\u2019s ransom\u2014gold enough to make a nobleman weep\u2014to purge the \u2018Drafty Shack.\u2019 He knew what was there; I knew what was there. These were Geists: ethereal horrors that ignore heavy plate and shatter mortal resolve with the void's own voice.<\/p>\n\n        <p>The prospect of the shack made the Vatt\u2019ghern medallion around [character:8690589]'s neck hum like a hornet\u2019s nest. I felt the fear rippling through the company. For a moment, the Raven\u2019s whispers were silenced by the primal urge to turn and flee. But we set out to fight much greater foe. If the dead are screaming, I shall teach them the meaning of silence.<\/p>\n\n    <p>The battle at the quarry lasted twelve rounds of psychological agony. The Geists drifted through the tall grass like pale silk; their first scream sent a wave of terror through our line that nearly saw [character:8770306] and [character:8769516]\u00a0killed in action. NeCola was our salvation. She moved with yellow eyes fixed on the flickers of mist, her spear carving through the incorporeal. I stepped forward, unleashing a Twisted Shock that arced through the cold air, striking a Geist with supernatural clarity, dissipating it into ozone and regret.<\/p>\n\n    <p>But the victory was blood-soaked. [character:8770309], the \u2018Melon Mugger,\u2019 was finally caught by a Geist\u2019s cold touch; his eyes glazed over as his life was drained, leaving his body a hollow husk for the flies to claim. [character:8769519]\u00a0took the brunt of the onslaught, his undead flesh shredded and mangled until he was more scar tissue than zombie. Yet, he stood as a silent anvil against the screaming dark.<\/p>\n\n    <h2>The possessed and the broken<\/h2>\n\n    <p>We returned to town, rich but frayed. I took a simple courier contract to return us to the lands where we begun the journey\u2014[location:8770017]\u2014hoping to recruit true elites at the Raven Watch. But the Changer is never so kind. Just outside [location:8770275], brigands stole the package. They were led by a Possessed Witchhunter\u2014a man hollowed out by the Usurper\u2019s malice and filled with a feverish, unnatural intensity.<\/p>\n\n        <p>I tracked them to a wobbly, abandoned homestead, my fury mounting with every mile. That a possessed dog of the Usurper dared touch my property was an insult requiring a public execution. I felt the Abyssal energies coiling around my fingers, hungry for the Witchhunter's blackened soul.<\/p>\n\n    <p>The siege of the homestead was a grizzly scene. I sent the fodders straight through the collapsed roof to draw the Witchhunter\u2019s fire. It was a calculated risk\u2014some might call it murder\u2014but in the Abyss's service, health is secondary to completion. As the Witchhunter barked orders with glowing eyes, [character:8690589]\u00a0bypassed the line of brigands and descended upon him like a vengeful spirit. She tore through four men in a flurry of silver and viscera, her spear finding the Witchhunter\u2019s heart even as his wardog snapped at her heels.<\/p>\n\n    <p>We won, but the victory left us shambling. Bardol and Arnulf each collected their fourth permanent injury; their bodies are now collections of rattling bones and weeping scars. [character:8770307], \u2018The Rabbit,\u2019 was torn so badly by the brigands that she finally succumbed to the Chaos Plague, rising from the mud as a zombified revenant. <\/p><h2>The Raven Watch<\/h2><p>We reached the gates of [location:8770276]\u00a0by Day 11, a macabre procession of the walking dead and the mutated, led by a mage with a pocket of gold and a mind full of darkness.<\/p>\n\n        <p>I look at the gates of Raven Town and I see not a sanctuary, but a forge. Here, with my riches, I will buy the steel and the souls I need to finally challenge the [character:8690591].\u00a0<\/p><div class=\"session-wrap\">\n        <p>We ended Day 11 outside the gates of Raven Town, approaching 10,000 crowns\u2014enough for elite recruitment at the Raven Watch.<\/p>\n\n        <h3>Key Engagements &amp; Losses:<\/h3>\n        <ul>\n            <li>The Fuhrtmark Harvest saw two successful battles against 26 total Bandit Rabble. NeCola proved her full recovery, and Jan F survived his baptism of fire.<\/li>\n            <li>The Purge of Drafty Shack was a 12-round struggle against Geists, securing a massive gold payout, but costing us Eufrosina (Melon Mugger), who was killed in action.<\/li>\n            <li>The final encounter, the Wobbly Shelter Siege, saw us retrieve a stolen package from a Possessed Witchhunter. Evett E (The Rabbit) became Zombified as a result of her injuries.<\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n\n        <h3>The Current State of the Company:<\/h3>\n        <ul>\n            <li>The \u2018Usurper\u2019s Bane\u2019 banner is raised, increasing renown and morale, but the core of the company has shifted significantly toward the undead and mutated, with Evett and Arnulf now providing a permanent unliving vanguard.<\/li>\n            <li>NeCola remains lethal, with 10 confirmed kills this session and damage dealt exceeding 1,700.<\/li>\n            <li>However, the costs have been steep: Arnulf (Zombie) sustained over 340 HP damage and now carries four permanent injuries. Bardol is in similar shape, carrying four permanent injuries from 185 HP damage.<\/li>\n            <li>Jan F (Apprentice) survived three major engagements, sustaining 183 total damage.<\/li>\n            <li>The encounter with the Possessed Witchhunter confirms the Demon Lord\u2019s influence is spreading south.<\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n\n        <p>With a purse full of gold and a roster of survivors, we stand before the Raven Watch. But in a world where the earth breathes and the dead scream, will even ten thousand crowns be enough to buy a soul that won't break?<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<hr>\n<table class=\"table table-centered\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <span style=\"color:rgb(200,202,208);text-align:right;\">\u2b05\ufe0f Return to\u00a0<\/span>[journal:8694710]\n      <\/td>\n      <td>||<\/td>\n      <td>\n        <p style=\"text-align:right;\">\n          Read next (coming soon)\u27a1\ufe0f\n        <\/p>\n      <\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table>","is_private":1,"tooltip":null,"is_template":null,"is_attributes_private":0,"focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"created_at":"2026-02-02T06:27:59.000000Z","updated_at":"2026-02-02T06:27:59.000000Z","created_by":365072,"updated_by":null,"image_path":null,"image_uuid":null,"header_image":null,"header_uuid":null,"marketplace_uuid":null,"reminders":[{"id":332428,"calendar_id":31926,"length":4,"comment":null,"is_recurring":0,"recurring_until":null,"recurring_periodicity":null,"colour":"#cccccc","day":7,"month":1,"year":1,"type_id":4,"visibility_id":1,"created_by":365072}],"mentions":[{"entity_id":8807699,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8770273},{"entity_id":8807699,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8770272},{"entity_id":8807699,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8770307},{"entity_id":8807699,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8770275},{"entity_id":8807699,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8770274},{"entity_id":8807699,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8770306},{"entity_id":8807699,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8769519},{"entity_id":8807699,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8690589},{"entity_id":8807699,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8769516},{"entity_id":8807699,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8770309},{"entity_id":8807699,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8770017},{"entity_id":8807699,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8770276},{"entity_id":8807699,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8690591},{"entity_id":8807699,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8694710}]}}
