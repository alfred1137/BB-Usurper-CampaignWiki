Although the\n  sickness of the Grasses still makes her movements sluggish, her predatory\n  grace hampered by the tremors of her rewiring biology.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  I look at the fishermen and I see only ticking clocks. They think the 'Raven\u2019s\n  Blessing' is a shield, unaware it\u2019s just a preservative for the meat I intend\n  to throw against the Usurper. My noble father would have recoiled at this; he\n  wanted me cloistered in an abbey, reciting hollow prayers to the Old Gods.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Instead, I recite the glyphs of the Raven Tome, watching the shadows dance to\n  a tune only I can hear.\n  [character:8690591]\n  sits on a throne of stolen blood, but I am the one who wades through the real\n  thing.\n<\/p>\n\n<h2>The breath of Skauna<\/h2>\n\n<p>\n  In\n  [location:8770270], we met Feremund the Steward. He was a nervous man, tasked with locating a\n  \"dark spot\" on a poorly drawn map near the region of Skauna:\n  <b>the Grim Tombs<\/b>. The journey was a descent into a persistent,\n  low-hanging mist that swallowed the sound of our boots.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  The air in Skauna tasted of dry earth and stagnant antiquity. We tracked the\n  slow, rhythmic pulse of necrotic energy thrumming beneath the soil and found\n  the tombs. We marked the site, informed our employer, claimed our coin, and\n  left the dead to their silence\u2014for now.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  The quiet, however, didn't last. As we stroll through the streets of\n  [location:8770270], a cowl-shaded man hissed at us from an alley, leading us to Councilman\n  Giselher, a man who clearly valued his golden crown above everything else. It\n  had been stolen by thieves who bypassed his guards with professional finesse.\n  I watched him turn an apple in his hand. His frustration palpable.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  Giselher spoke of losing 'things he loved,' but men like him love nothing but\n  the weight of gold in their palms. He thinks he is using me, but every\n  contract he provides is a whetstone for my power.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <span style=\"color:rgb(200,202,208);\">We set off in the afternoon of Day 4, the sun a pale, sickly disc, as we\n    tracked the scent of cheap wine and cold iron toward the north.<\/span>\n<\/p>\n\n<h2>A King of the North<\/h2>\n\n<p>\n  We found the theives as the shadows grew jagged and long. They were not mere\n  cutthroats; our employer clearly withheld some information from us. They were\n  led by a Champion who claims himself to be a <i>King of the North<\/i>\u2014a\n  massive man clad in furs and iron that looked forged in the heart of a\n  glacier.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  The air around him crackled with a supernatural chill. He looked at my\n  fishermen and saw only grass to be mowed. My frontline of fodders will not\n  hold; I have to risk sending in\n  [character:8690589]\u00a0into the fight.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  The Champion charged, a whirlwind of steel that should have ended us.\n  [character:8769519]\u00a0and the others were struck down in the first breath of the clash, their\n  bodies broken against the Champion\u2019s fury.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  [character:8690589]\u00a0<span style=\"color:rgb(200,202,208);\">stepped forward, but the lingering Trial-sickness betrayed her; her blades\n    found only the freezing air as her reflexes lagged.<\/span>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  In that moment, the glyphs of the Raven Tome flared white-hot in my vision. I\n  raised my hand and unleashed\u00a0<i>Twisted Shock<\/i>. It was a localized\n  collapse of the veil. The lightning arced through the mud, a jagged spear of\n  violet energy that bypassed the Champion\u2019s heavy plate and struck his defiant\n  soul.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Yet he persisted, charging at us even angrier than he was.\n  <i>Twisted Shock!<\/i>\u00a0I casted the spell again, and again, and again, as\n  [character:8690589]\u00a0hold up her long spear blocking the wild swings of our enemy.\u00a0\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  The smell of ozone and burnt hair filled the field after 5\n  <i>Twisted Shocks<\/i>. I have spent\u00a0 all my mana and am out of spell to\n  damage him any further. A powerful swing knock both both of us back flying,\n  but I noticed something,\u00a0<span style=\"color:rgb(200,202,208);\">the Champion\u00a0<\/span>is bleeding through the gaps of his steel armour.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  As that happen, for the first time in his life, felt the threat of the Abyss.\n  He chose flight over glory, retreating into the mists of Skauna.\u00a0<span style=\"background-color:unset;color:rgb(200,202,208);\">I watched him run, my fingers still tingling with the residue of the void.\n    We got lucky that he did not know that <\/span>[character:8690589]\u00a0and I were barely hanging in there.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  We survived, but the toll was heavy.\n  [character:8769519]\n  lay mangled and leaking vitality in the mud; while the other two were picking\n  themselves up from the severe injury they sustained from the struck down. Any\n  other captain would have mourned the lost of a company man. I simply waited.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  I watched the fodders as the Raven\u2019s 'last laugh' began.\n  [character:8769519]'s broken bones knit together with a sickening, wet crunch. His eyes remained\n  milky and unblinking. He rose, not as a man, but as a Cursed Shell\u2014a zombie\n  bound to my will. He needs no sleep. He needs no food. He is simply mine now\n<\/p>\n\n<h2>The caged wildling and the Western Road<\/h2>\n\n<p>\n  With the crown recovered and the company held together by bandages and dark\n  magic, we accepted a delivery for Giselher: a heavy crate destined for\n  [location:8770272].\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  On the march, we encountered Pike, leading a procession of cages. The air was\n  thick with the musk of predators\u2014snakes, bears, and a black cat. But the true\n  horror was the \"merchandise\" Pike had hidden away: a feral human, shackled and\n  gnawing on sticks in a cage of his own filth.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  Pike, with his ivory teeth and businessman's grin, asked for help. A helper\n  had gotten too close and become a corpse in the corner of the Wildman\u2019s cage.\n  The feral man was now sitting on the body, hissing. I looked at the cage and\n  then at my men. I sent Arnulf in. The dead should handle the dead. The Wildman\n  lunged, but the zombie had no fear for him to track. Arnulf simply soaked up\n  the blows with his unfeeling flesh while the others dragged the \"garbage\" out.\n  It was a cold, efficient transaction for 250 crowns.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n  We reached\n  [location:8770272]<i> <\/i>at dusk on Day 5, a procession of the maimed and the monstrous.\n  Sigfrid the Elder took the crate with grubby, trembling fingers, and I took\n  his gold.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  In the town square, I found a Flagellant, her back a lattice of self-inflicted\n  penance. She is a vessel already hollowed by suffering, perfect for the Chaos\n  Plague. Her name was\n  [character:8770307]. <i>Good<\/i>, another meat shield.\n<\/p>\n<i> <\/i>\n<h2>The shroud of Raven Town<\/h2>\n<i> <\/i>\n<p>\n  The sun sets on Day 5, and the \"Usurper\u2019s Bane\" is a name that now carries a\n  weight of dread. We have nearly three thousand crowns and a roster of souls\n  that defy the natural order. NeCola is finally finding her strength. But the\n  Raven whispers of bigger shadows. Giselher\u2019s \"ancient crowns\" are disappearing\n  with alarming frequency, and the \"Possessed\" are starting to scent the air.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  We march toward Raven Watch next, to find those \"worthy\" of our journey.\n  [character:8690591]\n  thinks he is the master of the dead, and I have only some fodders and a zombie\n  who refuses to die besides a\n  [race:8694294]\u00a0who is learning to hunt the very demons he commands.\n<\/p>\n<p>We needed more capable fighters.<\/p>\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n<hr>\n<table class=\"table table-centered\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <span style=\"color:rgb(200,202,208);text-align:right;\">\u2b05\ufe0f Return to\u00a0<\/span>[journal:8694710]\n      <\/td>\n      <td>||<\/td>\n      <td>\n        <p style=\"text-align:right;\">\n          Read next (coming soon)\u27a1\ufe0f\n        <\/p>\n      <\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table>","is_private":1,"tooltip":null,"is_template":null,"is_attributes_private":0,"focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"created_at":"2026-01-29T11:22:39.000000Z","updated_at":"2026-02-02T05:58:10.000000Z","created_by":365072,"updated_by":365072,"image_path":null,"image_uuid":null,"header_image":null,"header_uuid":null,"marketplace_uuid":null,"reminders":[{"id":331756,"calendar_id":31926,"length":5,"comment":null,"is_recurring":0,"recurring_until":null,"recurring_periodicity":null,"colour":"#cccccc","day":3,"month":1,"year":1,"type_id":4,"visibility_id":1,"created_by":365072}],"mentions":[{"entity_id":8786890,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8770270},{"entity_id":8786890,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8690589},{"entity_id":8786890,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8690591},{"entity_id":8786890,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8769519},{"entity_id":8786890,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8770272},{"entity_id":8786890,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8770307},{"entity_id":8786890,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8694294},{"entity_id":8786890,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8694710}]}}
