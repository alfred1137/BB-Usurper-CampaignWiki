They don't resist any status effects. They are the only creatures that can be raised as [race:8694890](undead).<\/p>\n\n    <div class=\"faction\">\n        <h2>Brigands<\/h2>\n        <p>Brigands are one of many Human factions in Battle Brothers. In the early game Brigand groups usually consist of Thugs and sometimes Raiders. Later, Raiders become more common and ranged attackers appear and their numbers increase. In the late game you will usually see a Brigand Leader and other elite enemies among them.<\/p>\n        <p>Their backline usually consists of Marksmen who give Brigands ranged superiority, and if they think they have it, they will stand their ground and shoot at you. It is especially true when you attack their fortified camps. Crossbowmen are especially deadly in the middle game. However, Brigands are often too undisciplined to maintain formation. Some of them can run towards you even when they have ranged superiority.<\/p>\n        <p>They have throwing weapons and try to use them, but lack of Quick Hands makes them not suited for this strategy.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n\n    <div class=\"faction\">\n        <h2>Nomads<\/h2>\n        <p>Nomads are one of many Human factions in Battle Brothers. They inhabit southern deserts.<\/p>\n        <p>Nomads are free people of the south who chose to live outside of the control of any city state. They travel the barren desert from one source of water to the next, hunting and scavenging, and living the freedom that they chose. Faced with surviving in this harsh environment, many nomads turn to banditry. It\u2019s not all of them, of course, but as a mercenary in this world it\u2019s who you\u2019ll be dealing with most of the time. Nomads have a roster of their own, roughly similar to that of northern brigands, but with their own equipment and a unique skill. Home in the desert and experienced in desert warfare, they use the environment to their advantage. Quite literally, in that they may throw sand in the faces of their opponents, inflicting the \u2018Distracted\u2019 status effect. A distracted target will inflict less damage and have less initiative for a single turn. Nomads populate the vast southern deserts surrounding the city states of the Gilders.<\/p>\n        <p>Nomads are basically southern Brigands. However they have better stats and gain Dodge in the middle game, becoming even more dangerous. In the late game Nomad Leaders and other elite enemies appear, especially in large Nomad camps.<\/p>\n        <p>Nomad Archers can be numerous, but Nomads still often prefer to approach despite their ranged superiority, and Archers reposition themselves. Their camps have no walls, and their behavior does not change when you are attacking a camp.<\/p>\n        <p>Nomads don't use throwing weapons, instead they throw sand in your face to lower initiative and damage output.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n\n    <div class=\"faction\">\n        <h2>Barbarians<\/h2>\n        <p>Barbarians are one of many Human factions in Battle Brothers. They inhabit northern part of the world.<\/p>\n        <p>In combat, a barbarian warband doesn\u2019t bother with formations, and they have no backline with polearms or dedicated archers. They are a horde of ferocious warriors in a constant shuffle of everyone trying to bring their weapons to bear against the enemy. They\u2019ll shower you with throwing weapons, they run towards your line, and they make ample use of the \u2018Adrenaline\u2019 perk to overwhelm you before you can even strike back. They don\u2019t fear death the same as other humans do, so they are not easy to break. They populate the far northen part of the map.<\/p>\n        <p>Barbarians' strategy is simply running towards their enemy and attacking with everything they have. Even their weakest units, Thralls, often have throwing weapons. Reavers bring many two-handed weapons that can hit hard. In the late game you will encounter armored Chosen, and entire warbands consisting only of them. Also their Armored Unholds will appear, and Beastmasters to control them.<\/p>\n        <p>Don't believe the tip on the loading screen that says they quickly become fatigued. It only happens if they use Adrenaline every turn to outspeed you, and it's not going to to happen quickly. Barbarians have high max fatigue and are often supported by hard to reach Drummers, who reduce fatigue they accumulate. Their Barbarian Fury is a variant of Rotation, but costs much less fatigue.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n\n    <div class=\"faction\">\n        <h2>City States<\/h2>\n        <p>City States are a type of Human factions in Battle Brothers. Southern city states send regiments to patrol surroundings, and caravans to trade with other settlements. Caravans are guarded by their melee units, usually Conscripts. Southerners are hostile to Noble Houses during the Holy War.<\/p>\n        <p>Southern faction is among the strongest in the game. Their infantry has Nimble, including polearm users. Their Gunners lower your accuracy with Overwhelm, making you less likely to hit their frontline, and they also hit your backline without penalty. Weapons like Swordlance and Handgonne do more damage to tight formations, while Backstabber works against sparse formations. And there are also deadly Assassins with their contraptions and Mortars bombarding you.<\/p>\n        <p>Southerners seem to not care about friendly fire, and will often hit their own troops with area attacks.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n\n    <div class=\"faction\">\n        <h2>Noble Houses<\/h2>\n        <p>Noble Houses are a type of Human factions in Battle Brothers. They are hostile to each other during the War of the Noble Houses, and hostile to southern City States during the Holy War. They send Supply Caravans, guarded by their troops.<\/p>\n        <p>Professional soldiers working on the payroll of one of the three Northern noble houses. Their patrols are a common sight and they protect supply caravans and the more well fortified towns and castles. Can be encountered through the Noble War, Holy War or by just being hostile to one of the houses through one of several ways.<\/p>\n        <p>Noble Houses have dedicated frontline, polearms and ranged units. Standard Bearers help to maintain high morale among soldiers. Elite units try to make a breakthrough where they are fighting. Some squads use Wardogs, which usually pointlessly die at the beginning of a fight.<\/p>\n        <p>The weakness of Noble squads is their suboptimal use of the Battle Forged perk. Medium armor is too light to work well with it, and Billmen wear even lighter armor like Gambesons and Aketon Caps, becoming very vulnerable for those who can attack them.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n\n    <div class=\"faction\">\n        <h2>Civilian<\/h2>\n        <p>Civilian factions are a type of Human factions in Battle Brothers. Each non-military settlement is a separate faction. They send caravans, peasants and, when enemies come close, can send militia squads to fight them.<\/p>\n        <p>Civilian faction isn't really combat-oriented. Its units are weak and can only rely on their numbers, even then only distracting the enemy or worse, making enemies confident, giving Nachzehrers many corpses to eat, and giving Orc Berserkers huge amount of Rage stacks.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n\n    <div class=\"faction\">\n        <h2>Mercenaries<\/h2>\n        <p>Mercenary companies travel between settlements, offering their service. They are not a faction, and attacking one company does not affect the others. But it does worsen your relations with the faction who hired them, and mercenaries hired by factions hostile to you will also be hostile.<\/p>\n        <p>Mercenaries don't have complicated tactics or gameplan. They attack and hope their Overwhelm will work and their armor will save them. They bring different weapons, sometimes nets and throwing weapons. Their armor can vary from very light to very heavy, so it is better to kill those who wear light armor, and hit poorly protected heads if you can target them.<\/p>\n        <p>Elite enemies that are among them can be problematic by themselves.<\/p>\n    <\/div>","is_private":0,"tooltip":null,"is_template":null,"is_attributes_private":0,"focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"created_at":"2026-01-13T02:55:28.000000Z","updated_at":"2026-01-13T08:49:41.000000Z","created_by":365072,"updated_by":365072,"image_path":null,"image_uuid":"a0d34ea4-f3d8-4125-b7b1-5c51f820e05a","header_image":null,"header_uuid":null,"marketplace_uuid":null,"mentions":[{"entity_id":8694293,"campaign_id":null,"post_id":null,"timeline_element_id":null,"quest_element_id":null,"target_id":8694890}]},"pivotLocations":[]}
