# Progress

## What Works

- The basic structure of a Jekyll-based wiki is in place.
- The project is configured to use the `git-wiki-theme`.
- Docker-based local development is set up.
- Kanka.io entities (Journals, Characters, Locations, etc.) have been migrated to the wiki.
- Assets are organized and linked correctly in the content.
- Internal wiki links are resolved to standard Markdown links ([Name](../path/to/Name.md)).
- Automated internal link maintenance via `/scan-wiki-links` workflow.

## What's Left to Build

- The visual style and branding (Catppuccin theme) may need further refining.

## Known Issues

- None at this time.
