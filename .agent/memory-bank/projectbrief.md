# Project Brief: BB-Usurper-CampaignWiki

This project is a Jekyll-based wiki for a "Usurper's Bane" campaign in the game Battle Brothers. It uses the `git-wiki-theme` to create a collaborative, markdown-based wiki.

The wiki documents the world, characters, and events of a heavily modded Battle Brothers campaign, including the "Legends", "Rise of the Usurper (RotU)", and "Path of the Vatt'ghern (PoV)" mods.
