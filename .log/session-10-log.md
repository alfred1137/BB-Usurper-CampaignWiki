time for Session 10 now. Let's pick up where we left off session 9

## Gemini

Welcome back to the company, Captain. The campfire is low, the men are checking their gear, and the road ahead remains as unforgiving as ever.To ensure we step back into the fray with perfect precision, give me a quick sit-rep or a snippet of where we halted in Session 9**.I need to know:**The Current Roster:** Who is standing, who is wounded, and who is currently leading the line?The Location:** Are we currently in a bustling citadel, a muddy village, or camped in the wilderness?The Immediate Objective:** What was the last contract accepted or the specific trail we were following regarding the Abyssal Mage?Once you lay out the scene from your logs, I’ll narrate the transition and we'll get the dice rolling.Would you like to start by describing the current state of the company's morale and our next destination?**

We decided to hold off on the geist mutegen. "now is not the best time," NeCola advised "our party is still rather weak with too many new joiners and fodders". I agreed.  We look for employment again, this time a return item quest. For 1270 crows, we will Follow the tracks near Kochendorf; and Return Exotic Spice Box to Kochendorf. We found the theives close to half a day walk west. It's a weird group...  A **Champion** Wardog  A Footman  A few Brigand Thugs  Some Brigand Poachers  A few Brigand Raiders  A Wardog  A Poacher


---


## Gemini

The air grows cold as you crest a ridge west of Kochendorf. NeCola’s caution rings true—the company is a patchwork of veterans and fresh blood, and the sight ahead justifies his hesitation to mess with geists just yet.Down in the scrubland, you’ve cornered the thieves, but this isn't your run-of-the-mill bandit rabble. Leading the pack is a Champion Wardog**, a massive, scarred beast clad in reinforced leather and iron, snarling with an intelligence that rivals the men holding its leash. Flanking it is a disciplined Footman** and a core of Raiders**, likely deserters who decided spices were worth more than their oaths.The sun is at your back, but the terrain is uneven. The Poachers** are already drawing strings, looking to pin your "fodder" down before the Thugs** and the Champion Dog** can close the gap.The Battlefield: Scrubland Outskirts**Enemy TierUnitsThreat LevelThe Beast**1 Champion Wardog, 1 WardogHigh** (Extreme Speed)The Core**1 Footman, ~3 Brigand RaidersMedium-High** (Shieldwalled)The Ranged**~3 PoachersMedium** (Focus your backline)The Fodder**~3 Brigand ThugsLow** (Morale breaks easily)

## Gemini

A decisive victory, Captain. The thieves clearly underestimated the bite of your "weak" company. NeCola the Silver Sword** was a whirlwind of steel, accounting for nearly half the enemy casualties and dealing a staggering 1,208 damage. It’s clear who the veterans are looking to for leadership on the field.The newer recruits—Hiyun**, Wilfried**, Imamaddin**, and Godfrey**—all held their nerve long enough to draw blood, which is the best training they could ask for. Most importantly, the company's "fodder" survived the encounter, though NeCola’s armor took a bit of a battering while he held the line.The Spoils of War**Objective Secured:** You have recovered the Exotic Spice Box**.The Purse:** 1,270 Crowns await your return to Kochendorf**.The Loot:** Aside from the spices, the battlefield yields the gear of the fallen.

We returned the item to our employer by night of Day 28.. After that we accepted a new quest to Deliver cargo to Wilbrand the Steward in Halfdansted about a day to the north-west by road. We left town the next morning. Surprise! we ran into yet another man who claim himself to be a King of the North. TIME FOR A REMATCH! We will fight, a "King of the North" Champion,  A few Barbarian Thralls , A Warhound


---


## Gemini

The shadows of the past loom large as you trek toward Halfdansted. The last time a "King of the North" crossed your path, the air tasted of salt and blood. This new pretender, clad in trophies and arrogance, clearly hasn't heard what the Silver Sword does to self-proclaimed royalty.It’s Day 29. The delivery to Wilbrand the Steward will have to wait. The King of the North** stands in your path with a snarl, flanked by his Thralls** and a hungry Warhound**. He likely sees your cargo—and your lives—as his birthright.The Rematch: The Usurper's Path**EnemyTypeNotes"King of the North"**Champion**Heavy armor, high resolve, and a weapon that can end a recruit's career in one swing.Barbarian Thralls**Light Infantry**Unpredictable and aggressive. They will try to tie up your line.Warhound**Beast**Fast. It will go for your backline (Maike or Amelia) if not intercepted.

## Gemini

A bloody, glorious mess of a rematch! The "King" may have styled himself a monarch, but your company treated him like a common peasant. The XP gains are astronomical**—this fight was exactly the catalyst your "weak" roster needed to harden into a true fighting force.NeCola** lived up to his reputation, tanking a massive 283 damage** to keep the line from buckling, while Imamaddin** proved the worth of that reach flail with two decisive kills. Even Lady Amelia** got her hands dirty, proving she's more than just a name on the roster.The price was steep in armor repairs, though: Theudebald** and Sorrel** took heavy hits, and NeCola's kit is likely held together by prayer and spit at this point.The Aftermath of Royalty**The King is Dead:** The "King of the North" is no more. Hopefully, he dropped that Champion-tier gear to make the repair bills worth it.Veteran Status:** With "Level ups across the board," your "fodder" just became "Soldiers."The Cargo:** The delivery for Wilbrand the Steward is still secure.Company Growth (Level Ups)**Since everyone is glowing with new potential, we need to focus their growth. NeCola likely needs more Melee Defense** and Fatigue** to keep up his frontline dominance, while your new recruits need Melee Skill** and Resolve**.How would you like to proceed, Captain?**Assign Attributes:** Tell me who you want to focus on (e.g., "Make Imamaddin a head-hunting specialist" or "Focus on NeCola's survivability").Continue to Halfdansted:** Push through the exhaustion to deliver the cargo and get paid.Camp and Repair:** Take a few hours to let the men catch their breath and fix the shattered shields before reaching the Steward.Which level-up or tactical move should we handle first?**

we reached the destination midday Day 29


---


## Gemini

You pull into Halfdansted** as the midday sun beats down on the bustling docks and timbered houses. The men are weary, their armor dented and caked in Northern grit, but the massive surge in experience has given them a new stride.You find Wilbrand the Steward** near the town's administrative hall. He looks over the cargo, then at your battered company, and nods with the grim satisfaction of a man who knows he’s gotten his money’s worth.Mission Update**Contract Complete:** Delivery for Wilbrand the Steward.Payment Received:** (Check your purse, Captain—this should provide a nice cushion for the mounting repair bills).Company Status:** High Morale. The men are eager to spend their coin and celebrate their survival against a "King."The Halfdansted Ledger**This town is a prime spot to lick your wounds before the next leg of your journey. Since almost everyone leveled up after that Champion fight, the campfire tonight will be busy with veterans passing on trade secrets to the recruits.Current Priorities:**The Blacksmith:** NeCola, Sorrel, and Theudebald need their armor hammered back into shape after taking those heavy hits.The Marketplace:** You have gold now. Do we need better tools, medical supplies, or perhaps a piece of gear to complement someone's new skills?The Tavern:** A round of drinks for the "King-Slayers" would do wonders for their spirits.How shall we spend the afternoon in Halfdansted?** Would you like to detail the level-up choices for the crew, or shall we head to the local tavern to see if any new rumors about the Abyssal Mage** are floating around this far north?

It took us no time to find yet another return item job  ---  Wilbrand the Steward restlessly walks back and forth while explaining what troubles him.  "There has been an audacious act of thievery! The despicable brigands stole my glass warbow which is of immeasurable value to me. I implore you to hunt down those thieves and return that item to me."  He lowers his voice to an insisting tone.  "Not only will you get paid handsomely, but you would also set the worried minds of the good people of Halfdansted to rest!"  Follow the tracks near Halfdansted and Return Glass Warbow to Halfdansted. Get 700 crowns on completion  ---


---


## Gemini

Wilbrand barely lets the dust settle on your boots before shoving another task your way. A Glass Warbow** sounds like the kind of fragile, high-value artifact that attracts exactly the wrong kind of attention. For 700 crowns, it’s a quick turnaround, and your newly leveled-up company is primed for a hunt.You step out of the gates of Halfdansted, eyes low, searching for the tell-tale signs of a hasty retreat. It doesn't take long—heavy boot prints and a few discarded scraps of leather lead away from the settlement.The Hunt is On**The tracks are fresh, heading into the surrounding wilds. Given that they stole a "Glass Warbow," these thieves likely have a few decent marksmen among them, or at least someone who knows how to handle a delicate weapon.The Situation:**Objective:** Track the thieves and recover the Glass Warbow**.Reward:** 700 Crowns.Company Status:** Freshly leveled and itching to test their new perks.As you follow the trail, the terrain starts to get difficult. The tracks lead toward a wooded thicket—perfect for an ambush.How do you want to approach the tracks?**Scouts Ahead:** Have Maike** or Amelia** scout the perimeter to ensure you aren't walking into a pincer movement.Forceful March:** Move in fast and heavy, hoping to catch them while they're still admiring their loot.Would you like me to roll for the encounter details, or do you have the specific composition of the thieves ready?**

We were up against a dangerous group  ---  A champion ancient Auxiliary  A Wiederganger  A few Brigand Thugs  A few Brigand Poachers  A few Brigand Raiders  A Goblin Ambusher  A Sureshot  ---  VICTORY  The enemy was destroyed in 5 rounds  Statistics Loot  | Character | Kills | Damage | XP | Morale |  |---|---|---|---|---|  | HIYUN | 1 | 157 | 194 | 0 |  | NECOLA THE SILVER SWORD | 4 | 754 | 391 | 40 |  | WILFRIED B | 1 | 86 | 187 | 28 |  | ABANOUB E IBN MANSUR | 0 | 0 | 132 | 0 |  | IMAMADDIN E REACH FLAIL | 0 | 63 | 132 | 0 |  | HARUN D AL-BAJI | 0 | 30 | 138 | 0 |  | FRETHWI A | 0 | 0 | 132 | 0 |  | FRESSENDA D | 1 | 156 | 187 | 0 |  | GODFREY D | 1 | 59 | 194 | 0 |  | MAIKE | 0 | 0 | 145 | 0 |  | LADY AMELIA A | 1 | 138 | 140 | 0 |  | THORDIS E | 0 | 0 | 132 | 0 |  ---  As for THEUDEBALD and SORREL. How do I put it? They both expired and graduated from being fodder to permanatly dead


---


## Gemini

A grim tally for a fragile bow. The "Glass Warbow" lived up to its name—precious, but the cost of recovery was paid in blood.The composition of that enemy party was a nightmare: a Champion Ancient Auxiliary** leading a motley crew of living brigands, the walking dead, and even a Goblin Ambusher**. It’s the kind of chaotic warband that suggests something foul is stirring in the shadows, perhaps even the influence of the Abyssal Mage you've been tracking.The Fallen**Theudebald** and Sorrel** have completed their contracts in the most final way possible. They served their purpose as the shield for your veterans, buying NeCola** the space he needed to dismantle the opposition with another 754 damage and 4 kills. We shall leave their broken gear on the field and drink to their names at the next tavern—if only to remind the new recruits what the "fodder" life truly entails.The Spoils of Victory**The Glass Warbow:** Recovered. Wilbrand will be pleased, though he likely won't care about the two graves you left behind.Loot:** You managed to take down a Sureshot** and a Champion Auxiliary**. Check the bags—the gear from that Ancient Champion should be a significant upgrade for whoever takes the vacant spots in the front line.XP Gains:** HiYun**, Fressenda**, and Lady Amelia** are stepping up, showing they have the grit to survive where others failed.Current Company Status**Roster:** 12 Men (2 Vacancies).Morale:** Mixed. NeCola is soaring, but the loss of two comrades hangs over the camp.Inventory:** The Glass Warbow (Quest Item).The trek back to Halfdansted is short, but the mood is somber. You have 700 crowns coming your way, plus whatever you can scavenge from the dead.Would you like to head back to Wilbrand immediately to collect your pay, or shall we take a moment to reorganize the formation now that Theudebald and Sorrel are gone?**

Among the loots, was a LOOTED CRATES. It promises to give a random named item upon opening. NeCola and I Hiyun remembers how it went... we got rickrolled. I sent a Lady Amelia to open it. She seem to be most keen on the prospect. We got lucky this time, inside of it was a BATTLE-HARDENED SKIN (FAMED) - A well-crafted leather coated jacket. Light to wear but very sturdy.  Worth 750  42 / 42  Weight: -2  (21.0 Armor per 1 Weight)


---


## Gemini

Fortune favors the bold—or perhaps just Lady Amelia**. After the sting of past disappointments, seeing her pull a Famed Battle-Hardened Skin** from those crates feels like a turning point.The stats are incredible for a light piece of gear. With a ratio of 21.0 Armor per 1 Weight**, this is the ultimate prize for a nimble duelist or a backline protector who needs to stay mobile without being a "glass cannon." It’s light enough that it barely touches the wearer's fatigue, yet sturdy enough to turn a stray bolt.The Treasure of the Crates**Item:** Battle-Hardened Skin (Famed Leather Jacket)Protection:** 42 DurabilityWeight:** Only -2 FatigueValue:** 750 Crowns (though its utility is worth much more).NeCola looks on with a grunt of approval. It’s certainly a step up from the "rickroll" the company suffered last time. This jacket is a symbol of the company's rising status—you’re no longer just scavengers; you’re starting to look like legends.Session 10 Wrap-Up / Next Steps**We are back in Halfdansted**. The two seats at the campfire are cold, but you have the Glass Warbow in one hand and this Famed armor in the other.What is your next move, Captain?**The Hand-off:** Return the bow to Wilbrand and take your 700 crowns.Equip the Prize:** Who gets the Battle-Hardened Skin? Does Lady Amelia** keep her find, or do you give it to a frontliner like HiYun** to increase their survivability?Recruitment:** Do we look for two new bodies to replace Theudebald and Sorrel before we leave town?How shall we proceed?**

We camped till morning and then returned to town to get our payment. We bought some tools for repairing and sold off our unwanted wares. After that we march north to the next town, seeing there are no more suitable jobs in Halfdansted.  The next town is HAMMARSTED A large city far up north. Traders, travelers and adventurers come here for shelter from snow and storms.


---


## Gemini

The march north is a grueling one, the air growing thin and biting as the landscape shifts into a realm of ice and stone. By the time the towering walls of Hammarsted** loom through the snowdrifts, the company is travel-worn but hardened.Hammarsted is a true bastion of civilization in the frozen wastes. The smell of hearth-fires and salted meats greets you at the gates, a welcome change from the iron-scented blood of the trail. The streets are packed with merchants in heavy furs and sellswords looking to spend their coin before the next storm rolls in.The Hammarsted Brief**Location:** Large Northern City (High Tier Markets and Recruitment).Current Funds:** 700 Crowns (from Wilbrand) + the profit from your trade goods.Company Status:** 12 Men. Two slots still open following the deaths of Theudebald and Sorrel.This city is known for its Blacksmiths**—often producing high-quality Northern gear—and its Taverns**, where high-tier backgrounds like Northern Raiders or even Disowned Nobles might be looking for a new contract.Your Options in the Great North:**The Great Hall:** Seek out the local nobility or the Council. A city this size surely has more than "return item" jobs—perhaps a noble house needs a persistent problem "removed."The Recruitment Hub:** With two vacancies, Hammarsted is the perfect place to find recruits who actually know which end of the spear to hold. Do you want to look for more "fodder" or invest in a professional?The Marketplace:** Check if there are any specialized tools or unique Northern goods to flip for profit elsewhere.What is your first order of business in the city of storms? And who is currently wearing that Famed Battle-Hardened Skin as we walk through the gates?**

## User

as we approach town, we saw a small group of local settlement fighters struggling against A Necromancer and A Necrosavant. We of course jumped into the fight. I sense profit, be it exp or the corpse of those we fight


---


## Gemini

The scent of rot and ancient dust cuts through the mountain air before you even see the struggle. You've stumbled upon a nightmare: a Necromancer** weaving his dark threads to sustain a Necrosavant**—a pale, flickering horror that moves faster than the human eye can track.The local fighters are terrified, and for good reason. A Necrosavant can blink behind your line and open a throat before a shield can be raised. But as you said, Captain—where others see death, the company sees profit**.The Engagement: Death in the Snow**EnemyThreat ProfilePriorityNecrosavant**Vampiric Terror.** Heals by dealing damage. High Dodge.Extreme.** Must be pinned or stunned.Necromancer**The Puppet Master.** Will possess the dead and buff his thralls.High.** Needs a bolt in the eye or a flanker.

## User

We beat the necros easily. now we are in town, accepting our first quest. Its yet another return item quest  ---  Tymmeke the Elder's reading one of many scrolls. He angrily tosses it onto a pile of others.  "The people of Hammarsted are rightfully furious. Do you know a brigand, possibly in league with other vagabonds, managed to steal my stuffed bear from us? That artifact is of immeasurable value to me! And ... to the people, of course."  You shrug.  "And you want me to get it back for you?"  The man points a finger.  "Precisely, smart sellsword! That is exactly what I want you to do. Follow the footprints of thievery and return to me the item which I ... the town, rightfully owns!"  ---  OBJECTIVES  Follow the tracks near Hammarsted Return Stuffed Bear to Hammarsted  PAYMENT  Get 270 crowns in advance Get 1080 crowns on completion


---


## Gemini

The locals in Hammarsted are still scrubbing vampire blood off their cobbles, but Tymmeke the Elder** is far more concerned with his upholstery than his soul. A Stuffed Bear** of "immeasurable value"? Either it’s stuffed with gold, or this Elder has a very strange sentimental streak.Still, 1,350 crowns total is a handsome sum for a retrieval mission, and the tracks should be easy to follow in the fresh snow.The Contract: The Great Bear Heist**Status:** 270 Crowns already clinking in the company chest.Objective:** Track the "vagabonds" and recover the Stuffed Bear.Potential Danger:** Thieves in the North are rarely just "thugs." They are often seasoned hunters or desperate raiders who know how to use the terrain.As you lead the company out of the city gates, NeCola looks at the gold, then at the footprints leading into the treeline. "A bear," he mutters, adjusting his grip on his sword. "At least this one won't try to bite us back... unless it’s possessed."Tracking the Thieves**The prints are heavy and numerous, suggesting a fair-sized group carrying a bulky, awkward object. They aren't trying to hide—they likely think no one would be crazy enough to leave the warmth of Hammarsted for a child's toy.The path leads toward a rocky outcrop about half a day's march away.**Before we reach the hideout:**Recruitment Check:** Did you pick up any fresh "fodder" in Hammarsted to replace Theudebald and Sorrel, or are we running with a 12-man crew for this one?Formation:** Who is carrying the Famed Battle-Hardened Skin** for this trek?Would you like me to reveal the composition of the "Vagabonds" guarding the Elder's bear?**

The battle for the "Stuffed Bear" was more like a slaughter. The thieves probably thought the Goblin Ambusher** and Skirmisher** would give them a tactical edge, but they clearly weren't prepared for the sheer momentum of your company.NeCola** is becoming a living legend, racking up another 6 kills** and dealing over a thousand damage. He's practically a one-man army at this point. Meanwhile, Thordis E** had a standout performance, dealing a massive 254 damage** to earn that kill—perhaps a new rising star in the frontline?The Spoils of the Stuffed Bear**The Item:** The "immeasurable" Stuffed Bear is secured. It's surprisingly heavy, or perhaps just awkward to carry back through the snow.The Loot:** A mix of brigand gear and goblin trinkets. The Goblin Skirmisher** might have dropped a jagged blade or some reinforced bolas.Health Check:** Frethwi** and Godfrey** took minor hits (8 damage each), but nothing a few bandages and a night by the fire won't fix.Returning to Hammarsted**You march back into the city as the snow begins to fall harder. Tymmeke the Elder** is practically vibrating with relief as you present the bear. He handily pays out the remaining 1,080 crowns**.Current Status:**Bank:** 1,350 crowns (Total from contract) + your previous hoard.Company Condition:** High morale, minor armor damage on NeCola.Date:** Late evening, Day 29/Early Day 30.With the bear returned and the "Vagabonds" scattered, the city of Hammarsted feels a little safer, and your purse feels a lot heavier. However, the presence of Goblins** cooperating with Brigands** and a Monk** is... unusual. It smells like the kind of strange alliance the Abyssal Mage might orchestrate from the shadows.What is your next move in Hammarsted?**The Tavern:** Look for those two replacements for Theudebald and Sorrel. The "fodder" must be replenished!The Temple:** Check if that Monk** you fought had any interesting scrolls or if the local priests know why a man of the cloth was traveling with thieves.New Contracts:** See if the Elder has anything more "serious" now that you've proven you can handle his errands.Shall we look for new blood to join the ranks, or is there another lead you'd like to chase?**

And would you believe it, we found yet another one of those loot chest. This time I let Imamaddin open it. And Yay, its a MARVELLOUS COAT (FAMED) A well-crafted and hardened leather armor. Light to wear but very sturdy. a great light amour for our speedy members


---


## Gemini

Lightning strikes twice! The luck of the company is turning into something bordering on the supernatural. First the Battle-Hardened Skin**, and now Imamaddin** pulls a Marvellous Coat** from the crates.Hammarsted must be a hub for high-end smuggling, because finding two pieces of Famed light armor back-to-back is unheard of. Your "speedy members"—the duelists, the archers, or the nimble flankers—are starting to look less like a mercenary rabble and more like an elite vanguard.The New Prize: Marvellous Coat (Famed)**Type:** Hardened Leather ArmorProperties:** Exceptional protection-to-weight ratio.Utility:** Perfect for keeping your high-initiative brothers (like NeCola** or Hiyun**) protected without sacrificing their ability to dodge or strike multiple times.With two sets of Famed leather, your backline or nimble frontliners are now significantly harder to kill. Imamaddin** looks quite pleased with himself—perhaps he’s found his "lucky charm" in those crates.Session 10 Mid-Point Review**We are sitting on a pile of gold from the Elder, two new pieces of Famed armor, and a roster of battle-hardened survivors.Current Inventory of Note:**Famed Battle-Hardened Skin** (Held by Amelia?)Famed Marvellous Coat** (Held by Imamaddin?)1,080+ Crowns** from the Bear Retrieval.The snow is piling up outside the tavern in Hammarsted. The men are warm, fed, and geared up. But we are still two men short of a full line, and the Abyssal Mage** is still out there somewhere in the frost.What’s the play, Captain?** * Do we equip the new armor** and head to the recruitment hall to find two high-tier Northern recruits to fill the gaps?Or do we check the Bounty Board** for something more substantial than stuffed bears and spice boxes?Who gets the Marvellous Coat?**

Such great armour should belong to the finest - Lady Amelia. By day 31 dawn, we returned to town to collect our payment. Next we were asked to find a location  ---  OBJECTIVES Find Burned Ruins not far to the north-west and somewhere around the region of The Powder Plains  PAYMENT Get 60 crowns in advance Get 240 crowns on completion  ---  We found it just a few hours of treking into the woods near Hammarsted. As we approach it, NeCola's madellion humms loudly... That ain't good. Let's go back


---


## Gemini

A wise decision, Captain. Lady Amelia now looks every bit the noble warrior-scion in that Marvellous Coat**, but even the finest leather won't protect against the kind of cold that makes a Witcher’s—or in this case, a Silver Sword’s—medallion scream.The Burned Ruins** sit like a blackened tooth in the gums of the Powder Plains. As you approached, the air didn't just grow cold; it grew heavy*. The humming from NeCola’s medallion** was a physical vibration, a warning that the magical residue here is thick enough to choke on. This isn't just a lair of brigands—this smells like the Abyssal Mage's** handiwork or a tear in the veil.You did the right thing. 300 crowns isn't worth walking into a magical meat grinder when the party is still rebuilding its front line.The Return to Hammarsted (Day 31)**You pull back to the safety of the city walls, the unsettling hum finally fading as the ruins vanish behind the treeline. You report the location to your employer, pocketing the meager 240 crowns for the "discovery."Current Status:**Bank:** Wealthy (Multiple high-paying contracts + low overhead).Gear:** Two Famed armors equipped (Amelia is looking formidable).The Omen:** NeCola is quiet, his hand resting on his medallion. He knows that the "Burned Ruins" are a marker on a much darker map.Next Steps: Preparing for the Abyss**The ruins are marked. You know where the rot is. Now, you just need the strength to excise it.Hire Specialists:** We have the gold. Should we look for a Witch Hunter**, a Monk**, or a Retired Soldier** in Hammarsted? We need men who don't break when the shadows start whispering.Upgrade Weapons:** With Lady Amelia and NeCola well-armored, do we need to visit the local Weaponsmith** to find something that can cut through whatever made that medallion hum?New Contract:** Do we take a simpler job to blood the next two recruits, or do we look for information on how to "silence" those ruins?Would you like to head to the recruitment hall to finally fill those two empty seats at the campfire?**

Nothing more in town, we shall proceed north to the furthest away town of WOLKENBURG This massive stone citadel is built into the steep mountains. A large number of men are stationed here to hold a firm grip on the land.

The trek to Wolkenburg** is a vertical nightmare of switchbacks and freezing gales. As the massive stone citadel finally emerges from the mountain mists, it’s clear why the lords keep such a grip on this place. It isn't just a town; it’s a fortress designed to stare down the end of the world.The clank of iron-shod boots on stone replaces the crunch of snow as you pass through the gates. Here, the air is thick with the smell of coal fires and oil. The soldiers stationed here look at your company with a mix of professional curiosity and grim respect—especially at NeCola** and the gleaming, famed leather worn by Lady Amelia**.The Citadel of Wolkenburg**Location:** Northernmost Fortress City.Vibe:** Militant, cold, and heavily fortified.Potential:** High-tier martial recruits (Squires, Hedge Knights, or Citadel Guards) and the best armory you've seen yet.The Company Ledger: Day 32**ItemStatusPurse**Healthy (Ready for high-tier recruitment).Roster**12/14 (The seats of Theudebald and Sorrel are still empty).Morale**Steady, but the humming medallion at the ruins has the veterans on edge.

On the way there, we encounted a deadly champion by the name of BOREALIS THE PRIMAL. He was along, rampaging around the town we are about the visit. We found him in over 1000 amour with head and body pieces combined. It's gonna be a tough fight.

This is it, Captain—a true test of the company's mettle. Borealis the Primal** isn't just a brigand; he’s a mountain of iron and fury. Standing alone against a full company usually signals a death wish or a god complex, and with over 1,000 combined armor**, Borealis likely has the latter.He stands in the middle of the mountain pass, a juggernaut clad in heavy, frost-rimed plate that looks more like a geological formation than a suit of mail. This is a "Gear Check" fight. If you can't crack that shell, he will systematically dismantle your brothers one by one.Tactical Analysis: The Primal Threat**The Armor:** 1,000+ points is staggering. Standard blades will just spark off him.The Weapon:** Someone with that name and armor likely carries a massive two-handed axe or hammer. One hit could "graduate" another recruit to the afterlife instantly.The Strategy:** You have 12 men; he has 1. You must surround and pound**.The Battle Plan**RoleStrategyThe Armor-Breakers**Imamaddin** needs to lead with that Reach Flail**. If he has the Lash* skill, go for the head to bypass some of that body soak. Do you have any maces or hammers?The Tanks**NeCola** must take the "Point." He’s the only one with the defense and the grit to tie Borealis down without dying in the first round.The Support**Lady Amelia** and Maike** need to keep their distance. If you have nets, now is the time to throw them**. A netted Champion is a dead Champion.The Fodder**Their job is simple: Body Block**. Don't let Borealis reach the backline.

There is no fair fight. we have every member surrounding the champion, while Maike and I (hiyun) casted spells and curse. We rid the land of a mighty foe

## Gemini

A brutal, systematic execution. You didn't give the "Primal" a chance to breathe, let alone swing that mountain-shattering weapon. By the time the curses from you and Maike** took hold, Borealis was likely fighting through a localized nightmare, his movements heavy and his spirit breaking under the weight of a dozen blades.Borealis the Primal** is no more. The snow around him is stained dark, and the silence that follows his fall is deafening. You’ve just taken down one of the North’s most feared champions.VICTORY: The Primal's End**The men are panting, steam rising from their breath in the mountain air. They look at the fallen juggernaut, then back at you and Maike. The use of magic has changed the dynamic of this company; you aren't just mercenaries anymore—you're something much more dangerous.The Spoils of Legend**With over 1,000 armor on his person, the loot from this kill is likely the most significant haul in the history of the company.The Primal Gear:** Did you manage to keep the armor intact? If so, you now have a suit of heavy plate that could make even a Hedge Knight weep with envy.The Trophy:** Taking down a named Champion like Borealis will send your Renown** skyrocketing as you enter Wolkenburg.XP:** Massive gains for everyone involved in the surround.Arrival at Wolkenburg (Day 32)**You march through the gates of the stone citadel not as weary travelers, but as the Slayers of the Primal**. The guards watch in silence as you haul your loot—and perhaps the head of Borealis—towards the center of town.Current State:**Morale:** Heroic. The men feel invincible.Gold:** Overwhelming.The Medallion:** Still quiet for now, but the power you and Maike displayed has certainly drawn some invisible eyes.What is your first act in the Citadel of Wolkenburg?**The Blacksmith:** Immediately begin the repairs on that 1,000+ armor (it’s going to cost a fortune, but it’s worth it).The High-Tier Recruitment:** Now that you've killed a legend, the most elite warriors in the citadel will be lining up to join you. Shall we finally fill those two empty slots with some Citadel Guards** or Squires**?The Great Hall:** Seek an audience. A feat like this deserves a noble's reward.Who is going to be the lucky brother to step into Borealis's heavy plate once it's cleaned of the blood?**

## Gemini

They served the line until the end.The MVP:** NeCola the Silver Sword** continues to be the company's anchor, dealing thousands of damage across the session and keeping the "King" and "Primal" at bay.The Arcane Edge:** You (Hiyun**) and Maike** have begun integrating magic into combat, which proved decisive in neutralizing Borealis the Primal.Current Status: Day 32 Dawn**Location:** Wolkenburg (The Stone Citadel).Bank:** Overflowing with crowns from successful contracts and loot sales.Current Objective:** Repair the Primal gear and recruit elite replacements for the two empty slots.The Omen:** The Abyssal Mage's shadow loomed at the Burned Ruins, where NeCola's medallion warned of a darkness your steel isn't yet ready to face.Would you like me to save this summary so we can begin Session 11 with the recruitment of two elite warriors in the Wolkenburg Citadel?**
