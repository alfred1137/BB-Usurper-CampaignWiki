Hello game master. Let's begin our scenario of the Abyssal Mage


---


## Gemini

Greetings, traveler. The shadows lengthen and the air grows cold as we begin your descent into the world of Battle Brothers*.You are the Abyssal Mage**, a figure of whispered dread and forbidden knowledge. While others seek gold or glory, you seek the essence of the void itself. Your journey begins on the outskirts of a crumbling hamlet, the wind howling through the gnarled trees like the souls of the damned.Behind you stand your first few thralls—men desperate, brave, or foolish enough to follow a master of the dark arts.Current StatusOrigin:** Abyssal MageMood:** CalculatingLocation:** The Southern Wilds, near the village of Eisdorf**.The world is a cruel place, and the common folk fear what they do not understand. You have a meager purse of crowns and a handful of mouths to feed. To your north lies the civilized world of noble houses; to your south, the ancient, shifting sands.How shall we begin?** Please upload a screenshot** of your starting roster or the world map so I can begin narrating your dark path. Alternatively, tell me: do you wish to enter the village to look for "recruits," or shall we head into the wilderness to find a source of power?


---


## Gemini

The void stirs, and the path opens before you. As the Abyssal Mage**, your presence is a blight upon the natural order—a fact the local peasantry will soon learn to fear.In this world of iron and blood, your magic is fueled by the very essence of your enemies. Whether you choose to raise the fallen as mindless thralls or twist the minds of the living, your legend begins here.Your Dark RetinueBefore we take the first step, I need to know who is standing in your shadow.The Roster:** Who are your starting companions? (Are they cultists, fallen knights, or simple desperate peasants?)The Ambition:** Do you seek to build a mercenary company as a front for your rituals, or do you intend to bring the noble houses to their knees?Show me your hand, Master.** Upload a screenshot** of your party's attributes or the world map, and I will weave the surroundings into our tale. Or, simply tell me: Are we heading into Eisdorf to demand tribute, or are you looking to "harvest" something from the nearby woods?**

## User

NeCola is my starting companion. Our mission is to destroy the usrupur king. Hiyun is me, the mage with green face. NeCola is the white hair lady


---


## Gemini

The stage is set. Hiyun**, your ghastly visage reflects the depths of the Abyss, a striking contrast to the cold, silver-maned presence of NeCola**. Together, you form a duo that strikes a balance between arcane rot and sharpened steel.The Usurper King** sits upon a throne built of lies and stolen blood, oblivious to the shadow creeping toward his gates. But even a Mage of the Void cannot topple a kingdom alone; your power is vast, but your physical vessel is still bound by the limitations of this mortal realm.The Inner CircleHiyun (The Abyssal Mage):** Your green skin marks you as a pariah, but your eyes hold the secrets of the rift. You provide the vision.NeCola (The White-Haired Guardian):** Your first and most loyal blade. Her striking hair is the last thing many will see before her steel finds their throat.The First MoveYou stand at a crossroads on the outskirts of the kingdom. To reach the Usurper, you must first gather strength—either in coin, corpses, or influence.What is our first move toward the King's downfall?**Seek the Outcasts:** Head to a nearby tavern or roadside camp to find more "expendable" muscle who won't ask questions about your face.Siphon the Land:** Search for a nearby graveyard or a site of a recent skirmish to see what "resources" Hiyun can manifest from the veil.Establish a Front:** Take a simple contract from a local village to earn crowns and blend in as a "mercenary" company.I am ready for the first screenshot of your journey, or simply tell me which path we take.**

## User

NeCola just survived the trial of the grasses. she is now sick


---


## Gemini

A heavy price for power. The Trial of the Grasses** is a brutal alchemy, and while NeCola’s spirit is iron, her flesh now pays the toll. She staggers, her white hair matted with cold sweat, the mutagens screaming through her veins as her physiology rewires itself into something... more.She is now a Witcher in the making, but for now, she is a liability on the battlefield. Her reflexes are dulled by fever, and her breathing is labored.Current State: The Fever DreamsNeCola:** Status [Sick]**. Her attributes are severely penalized. Sending her into a fray now would be sending her to her grave.Hiyun:** You must guard her while she stabilizes. A Mage is most vulnerable when their protector is bedridden.The Game Master's GuidanceThe village of Eisdorf** (or whichever settlement is closest) offers a choice. Do you hide in the shadows of the forest until her fever breaks, or do you risk entering a town to find a healer?What is your command, Hiyun?**Find a Healer:** Attempt to find a temple or a doctor to speed her recovery (though they may recoil at your green skin).Hunker Down:** Set up a hidden camp in the wilds and wait for the sickness to pass, hoping no brigands stumble upon your position.The Alchemical Risk:** Do you have any strange concoctions in your inventory that might "help," or shall we let the trial run its course?If you have a screenshot of her current stats or the town menu, show me—I’ll help you calculate the risk.**

I will recruit a bunch of nobodies to get things rolling. I needed protection afterall. We walked into Stohl, the nearest town. 3 fishermen were sitting in the town centre with nothing to sell. For about 600 coins, they were willing to travel with me for possible adventure. Little do they know - they will be fodders to my conquest. My raven blessing was granted on two of them. Still, I do not expect them to survive. I led the crew to look for quest, the conversation below shows how that went:  A bird is perched on Reinmar of Stohl's window. The man, seated, points at it.  "I wonder if that's how they got in. The brigands, I mean. I think they must've snuck through a window and then right back out. That's how they got away with my enchanted dagger."  The man slowly rises and stalks across the room. He crouches, about ready to pounce on the bird, but the creature scatters before the man can so much as flinch.  "Damn."  He returns to his seat, wiping his hands as if he'd worked up a sweat during his attempted avian ambush.  "My task is simple, sellsword. Bring my property back to me. Kill the brigands, too, if you wouldn't mind."  "Rest assured that what I'm offering you now is a fine prize for your work. It's 240 crowns when the contract is done."  And so we accepted the mission


---


## Gemini

A wise, if cold, tactical maneuver, Hiyun. The Void requires vessels, and these three fishermen—plucked from their nets and smelling of brine—have no idea they’ve traded the sea for a much deeper, darker abyss.The Raven’s Blessing** you bestowed upon two of them is a cruel irony; they likely feel invigorated, unaware that you've simply marked them as more "durable" meat for the grinder.The War Band GrowsHiyun:** The Green-Faced Master, watching from the rear.NeCola:** Still shivering from the Grasses, clutching her blade in the shadows.The "Fish-Fodder":** Three nameless peasants, now the vanguard of your dark ambition.The Mission: The Enchanted DaggerReinmar of Stohl is a fool, distracted by birds while his treasures slip through his fingers. 240 crowns** is a pittance for a Mage of your stature, but the Enchanted Dagger**... that is a curiosity. If the brigands have it, perhaps they’ve learned how to make it bleed.Reinmar's** failure to catch a simple bird bode well for you; if the local "nobles" are this incompetent, the Usurper King’s foundation may be rotter than we thought.The Path AheadThe brigand tracks lead away from the village, likely toward a hideout in the scrubland or a nearby forest.How shall we handle the first skirmish?**The Meat Shield Strategy:** Put the fishermen in the front line with whatever rusty hatchets or pitchforks they have. Let them soak the initial charge.Arcane Support:** Will you use your abyssal powers to sow terror among the brigands while they are distracted by the peasants?The Witcher's Shadow:** Is NeCola fit enough to stand, or will she remain in the reserve while the "fodder" proves their worth?Show me the battlefield or your current party screen once you find these thieves, and we shall see whose blood waters the earth first.**


---


## User

We found the brigands not far to the west of town. This is their composition


---


## Gemini

Answering the call of the void! Please upload the screenshot** or describe the numbers and equipment** of these brigands.Knowing whether we are facing starving thugs with clubs or armored raiders with shields will determine exactly how much "work" your new fisherman friends have to do.While I wait for the visual or the headcount, consider this:The Mage's Calculus:** If the brigand leader is holding that enchanted dagger, his strikes will be swifter and deadlier than a common thief's.I am ready. What are we looking at across the field?** (Once you provide the composition, I’ll help you set the battle line!)


---


## User

NeCola will take a rest from this battle. HiYun and the fodders will fight the brigands.


---


## Gemini

A wise decision. NeCola** is far too valuable an investment to risk while her blood is still thick with mutagens. Let her watch from the wagons; let her see how the Abyssal Mage conducts a symphony of slaughter.You stand at the edge of a clearing, the wind carrying the scent of woodsmoke and unwashed men. Opposite you, the brigands leer, spotting only a green-skinned freak and a handful of trembling men who still smell of fish guts. They think this will be an easy mark.The Battle ArrayThe Vanguard:** The three fishermen. They hold their shields with white knuckles, their "Raven's Blessing" humming beneath their skin. They are the wall—porous, perhaps, but sufficient.The Center:** Hiyun**. You stand behind the meat, your fingers tracing patterns in the air, the Abyssal energies coiling around your staff like hungry vipers.The EngagementThe brigands begin their loping advance. One whistles through a gap in his teeth, hefting a rusted shortsword—the very one Reinmar wants back.How do you open the dark ritual of combat?**Sow Terror:** Use your magic to break their morale before they even reach the fishermen. A panicked man is easier to butcher.Let Them Clash:** Wait for the brigands to commit to the fishermen, then unleash a concentrated burst of Abyssal rot upon their leader.The Raven's Toll:** If one of the "fodder" falls, will you use their freshly released soul to fuel a more powerful spell?Tell me your opening move, or show me the tactical map if the lines have met!**


---


## User

The fight went as smooth as it could


---


## Gemini

The void provides. It seems the fishermen were more resilient—or perhaps more terrified of you than the brigands—because the field is now silent, save for the wet thud of looting.The brigands lay scattered like broken dolls, and that "enchanted" dagger now glints in your hand, its edge humming with a faint, unnatural resonance. Reinmar expects it back, but a tool of such potential might be better served in the hands of the Abyssal Mage** or a recovered NeCola**.Aftermath of the SkirmishThe Fodder:** Did all three survive? If so, they’ve earned their first taste of blood. The Raven's Blessing has held... for now.The Spoils:** You have the dagger and likely a few suits of sweat-stained leather and rusted blades.The Master:** Hiyun**, your presence on the field has shifted the air. The peasants look at you with a new kind of silence—the silence of the hunted realizing their predator is nearby.The Next StepWe have the objective. Stohl** is a short walk away.Honorable Return:** Hand the dagger back to Reinmar, take the 240 crowns, and use the coin to buy better armor for your "surviving" meat shields.The Mage's Greed:** Keep the dagger for yourself or NeCola. You'll lose the gold and the town's trust, but gain a magical edge.The Butcher's Bill:** Before heading back, do you wish to perform any... additional* rites on the corpses of the brigands?What shall we do with the spoils, and how is NeCola’s recovery progressing?** (If you have a screenshot of the loot or the party's level-ups, now is the time!)


---


## User

surprise surprise. among the loot is this crate. We opened it and it was...


---


## Gemini

The tension in the air thickens as you pry the lid from the heavy, iron-bound crate. The wood groans, and a faint, stale mist escapes from the interior, smelling of ancient dust and ozone.What lies within?**A Relic of the Old Empire?** A piece of blackened plate armor that seems to pulse like a slow heartbeat.Forbidden Tomes?** Pages of vellum that whisper secrets of the Usurper King’s true lineage.Something Living?** A creature or a captive that Hiyun can bend to his will.Show me the contents, Master.** (Upload the screenshot of the item or describe its properties!)The fishermen lean in, their eyes wide with a mix of greed and primal fear. Even NeCola, pale as she is, shifts in her sleep as the energy from the crate ripples through the camp.Is this the key to the Usurper's downfall, or a curse that will consume your "fodder" before they ever reach the palace gates?**


---


## User

It was an ancient recording of rickroll... we have been rickrolled... no treasure, just music that will not give us up


---


## Gemini

The void... it stares back, and sometimes, it hums a catchy synth-pop melody from the 1980s.As the lid creaks open, there is no shimmering steel or pulsing soul-gem. Instead, a bizarre, brass-fitted contraption begins to spin, emitting a spectral, rhythmic tune that defies all known laws of magic. The lyrics echo through the clearing: “Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down...”*Hiyun**, your green face somehow pales. You have delved into the deepest pits of the Abyss, but you have never encountered a curse this... relentless.The Reaction:**The Fishermen:** They stand frozen, oars-turned-spears forgotten. One of them begins to tap his foot rhythmically. You may need to execute him immediately to preserve the grim atmosphere of your conquest.NeCola:** In her fever dream, she mutters about "deserting" and "hurting you." The trial of the grasses is hard enough without a multidimensional bard haunting her psyche.The Raven's Blessing:** Even the ravens overhead seem to caw in a specific, upbeat tempo.The brigands didn't steal a dagger; they stole a localized collapse of the space-time continuum. Reinmar of Stohl didn't want his "property" back—he wanted to get rid of it.What is your command, Master of the Abyssal Pop?**Weaponize the Cringe:** Smash the box and use its shards to forge a weapon of pure psychological torment.The Ultimate Sacrifice:** Throw the crate into the nearest deep well and never speak of this to the Usurper King.Accept the Fate:** March back into Stohl with the music blaring. If you're going to be a dark lord, you might as well have a theme song that promises you'll never run around and desert your followers.Shall we return to Reinmar and demand an explanation for this sonic assault?**

## User

heres the latest with our economy. Lets take another quest


---


## Gemini

A truly "Abyssal" economy, then. You have been played for a fool by a man who chases birds, and your coffers likely reflect the insult of being paid in 20th-century pop culture rather than cold, hard crowns.The fishermen are looking at you, Hiyun. They survived the brigands, they survived the Rickroll, but they won't survive hunger. If the economy is lean, we need a contract that pays in blood and gold, not irony.What is the next move for the Abyssal Mage and his silver-haired ward?**The Job Board in StohlSince Reinmar's "enchanted" treasures are a bust, the local burgomeister or a desperate merchant might have something more tangible."Drive off the Greenskins":** A local farm is being harassed. Simple work for fishermen, and a chance for you to see if your green skin helps you blend in—or if they'll try to kill you too."The Graveyard Shift":** A request to clear out some "restless dead." This is your element, Hiyun. Why pay for recruits when the ground is full of free labor?"Caravan Guard":** It’s slow, it’s boring, but it pays for the grain and the medicine NeCola needs to stop seeing Astley in her dreams.Show me the contract screen or the map!** Let’s see where the Usurper King’s influence is weakest so we can start tearing it down.Would you like me to analyze your current party's gear to see who's most likely to die in the next contract?**


---


## User

Here's the job story I took  Dim candles barely light the room enough for you to see, it's Reinmar of Stohl sitting behind his desk while his shadows dance on the walls by the tune of flickering lights.  "Would you lend your swords to me if I paid you good coin? I need a small chest delivered safely to Eike of Thal in Thal, about a day of travel east of here. Men have killed each other over this, so you must be ready to defend it with your life."  He takes a pause, measuring your response.  "I will write a sealed letter with instructions to pay you as you deliver the item to my contact in Thal. What say you?"  He jingles with a bag of coins.  "This will be yours if you help me out on this. You'll be paid 20 crowns in advance, and another 100 when the job is done."


---


## Gemini

Reinmar of Stohl truly is a man of secrets—and perhaps a man of very few crowns. Offering a mere 120 crowns** for a chest men have "killed each other over" is either an insult to your power or a sign of how desperate the local economy has become.Still, Thal** lies to the east. A day's march is exactly what NeCola** needs to sweat out the last of the mutagens, and a "small chest" is much easier to carry than a crate full of cursed melodies.The Master's AnalysisThe Advance:** 20 crowns. Barely enough to keep the fishermen fed and their "Raven's Blessing" from turning into a "Raven's Hunger."The Risk:** Reinmar warned that men have killed for this. Expect an ambush on the road. The fishermen will finally earn their keep—or provide the road with fresh fertilizer.The Mystery:** After the Rickroll incident, one has to wonder... is there actual gold in this chest, or another relic from a world beyond?The March BeginsYou step out of Stohl, the "fodder" flanking the mule, and NeCola leaning heavily on her sword-staff as you head toward the rising sun. The road to Thal is dusty and fraught with shadows.How shall we travel?**Forced March:** Push through the night to reach Thal as quickly as possible. (Risky for a sick NeCola, but minimizes ambush time).The Mage's Vigil:** Move at a steady pace, with Hiyun using his senses to scour the treeline for the "men who would kill" for this chest.The Ritual Path:** Take the long way through the woods; it’s slower, but the shade will help NeCola’s fever, and the corpses of any forest creatures could provide "materials."Tell me, Hiyun: Do we trust Reinmar this time, or are you planning to "accidentally" break the seal on that letter to see what he’s really up to?**


---


## User

We will march towards the destination honouring the quest. On the way, we will stop by hammererden


---


## Gemini

A calculated move. Hammererden** provides a necessary waypoint to steady the ranks before the final push to Thal. As you march, the rhythm of the "fish-fodder’s" boots on the dirt road serves as a constant reminder of the life-force you now command.NeCola** manages to keep pace, her breathing rhythmic but heavy. Every mile traveled is another victory over the mutagens ravaging her system. The silver-haired warrior is a survivor; the Trial will either forge her into a weapon of the Abyss or break her entirely.Arrival at HammererdenAs the settlement comes into view, the smell of coal smoke and hot iron fills the air. Hammererden is a place of industry—of smiths and sturdy men.While we are here, what is your intent, Hiyun?**Market Research:** Check the local smithy. If these fishermen are to survive the "men who would kill" for Reinmar's chest, they might need more than salt-stained tunics. Even a few pieces of scrap metal could save a "blessed" life.The Mage's Inquiry:** Visit the local tavern or marketplace to see if rumors of the Usurper King's** influence have reached this far east. Knowledge is a weapon sharper than any dagger.Rest and Recovery:** Spend a few crowns on decent rations and a soft bed for NeCola to ensure she is battle-ready by the time you reach Thal.The "men who would kill" are likely watching the roads between here and Thal. How do you wish to spend your time in Hammererden before the final leg of the journey?** (Feel free to share a screenshot of the town or your party's current status!)

## User

We reacher hammererden in the middle of the night. I know there are plenty of things to search for during the night. Sure enough we encountered the following:  # event 1  Asking around for ingredients, you are pointed to the location of two outsiders, visitors to this area. "They seems weird enough, like yous! You may find what you need" was the precise wording of a kid that bothered to help you. You find them near an alley, talking in their own weird tongues. You decide to ask them anyways, and without hesitation, a young brazen man replies.  " Чё ты вообще к нам лезешь? Чего ему от нас надо? Пусть валит на чёрный рынок – любую хрень найдут! Сечёшь? Поспрашивай ночью, эти мутные барыги, может, чем-  you are not sure if the guy is angry or not, and you did not really understand a thing. Before you are able to speak the other man chimes in.  " Κλέφτες, λαμόγια όλοι τους. Που τον στέλνεις; Μην ασχοληθείς με τους ληστές του βορρά, νότια, στα εδάφη και χώρες που οι κάτοικοι εδώ ούτε γνωρίζουν. Θα ψάξεις να βρείς αλχημιστές, βοηθήσουν αυτοί αν έχεις το ρευστό. "  They then start arguing with each other. Their spoken languages audibly different, yet they somehow have full understanding of each other's words. You did not really understand much, and you know you won't, you waive them goodbye and go on your way.  # Event 2  We search on for goodies.  The town's back alleys twist like gutted snakes, the air thick with the stench of rotting straw and piss-soaked mud. You ask after the anatomist in hushed tones, met with uneasy glances and hurried denials. Finally, a beggar points a knotted finger toward a sunken door, its frame blackened by years of smoke and secrecy. A rusted iron bell hangs beside it. One pull, and the door creaks open just enough for a sliver of candlelight to escape.  Inside, the apothecary's den reeks of preserving salts and something fouler, a metallic tang that clings to the back of your throat. Shelves groan under jars of pickled organs, their murky fluids catching the dim candlelight. At the center of the room, a figure clad in a long, waxed coat and a beaked mask turns toward you, gloved hands resting on a table strewn with scalpels, bone saws, and vials of unnamable substances.  " You seek something. An ingredient, yes? One of those... delicate components not easily found in the wilds or pried from common merchants' hands. I can provide it. But knowledge demands sacrifice. A trade must be made: flesh for flesh! One of your men, willingly given, to endure my... investigations. I assure you, no lasting harm will come to him. But the process? Ah. Pain is the toll of understanding. "  The anatomist tilts his head, the glass lenses of his mask reflecting the flickering flame. A long silence stretches as he waits for your answer.  The company gathers in the den's dim backroom, the alchemist's request hanging heavy in the air. No man volunteers. With grim resignation, you cut straws - the shortest drawn by Bardol, who meets his fate with a soldier's stoicism. The anatomist's workshop smells of vinegar and burnt hair. He motions Bardol toward an iron-framed table, its leather straps worn shiny from use. As the door closes behind you, the last thing you see is the gleam of surgical steel in candlelight.  Three hours pass before Bardol reappears, moving stiffly but under his own power. He wordlessly presses a glass phial into your hand - the precious ingredient - now slick with sweat.  " Fascinating circulatory system! You breed them tough in the mercenary trade. "  Bardol spits in the dirt as you leave. He'll recover in time, but none of the men ask what happened behind that door. Some questions are better left unanswered.  You get an Unhold's Heart  Bardol suffers serious wounds

## Gemini

The darkness of Hammererden has birthed strange fruit. Your visit to this industrial town has taken a turn for the macabre, fitting for an Abyssal Mage**.The First Encounter: Echoes from the BeyondThe two outsiders speaking in tongues—Russian and Greek—are a rift in reality itself. While they bickered, they gave you two cryptic pieces of advice:The youth suggested the Black Market**, hinting at shifty dealers who appear only at night.The older man warned against the northern thieves, pointing your gaze South** toward the lands of the Alchemists** (the Gilded City-States), where gold buys true arcane secrets.It seems the world of Battle Brothers* is larger and more fractured than the Usurper King realizes.The Second Encounter: The Butcher’s TollYou proved your ruthlessness, Hiyun. To trade the agony of your own man for a component is the mark of a true master. Bardol** may have drawn the short straw, but he has effectively "donated" his vitality to your cause.The Prize:** Unhold's Heart.** This is a massive, muscular organ, still thumping with a faint, regenerative rhythm. In the hands of a Mage, it can be used to craft powerful potions or armor attachments that allow the wearer to heal wounds as they fight.The Cost:** Bardol is Seriously Wounded**. He is no longer "fodder"; he is a broken man who needs time to knit his flesh back together. If he survives, he will have stories that will keep the other fishermen awake at night.Current State of the CompanyHiyun:** Possesses a rare alchemical ingredient.NeCola:** Still recovering, now joined in the sickbay by the mangled Bardol.The "Healthy" Fodder:** Two fishermen remaining, likely eyeing you with newfound terror after watching what happened to their friend.The Path to ThalYou have the Heart, you have the Chest, and you have two crippled soldiers. Thal is still a day's march away, and Reinmar's "men who would kill" are still out there.What is your next move in the dead of night?**The Alchemical Experiment:** Do you attempt to use the Unhold's Heart immediately to aid NeCola’s recovery, or save it for a greater ritual?Leave Hammererden:** Slip out under the cover of darkness before the town guards ask too many questions about Bardol’s screams.Check the Black Market:** Since the outsiders mentioned it, do you want to spend a few more hours scouring the docks or alleys for these "shifty dealers"?The Raven's Blessing is stained with Bardol's blood now, Hiyun. How shall we proceed?**


---


## User

we camp until morning.


---


## Gemini

The fire crackles low as the company huddles together in a makeshift camp on the outskirts of Hammererden. The night is long, filled with the rhythmic thumping of the Unhold's Heart** inside your pack and the muffled groans of Bardol** as his wounds weep into his bandages.By the time the grey light of morning breaks over the horizon, the atmosphere has shifted.The Morning ReportNeCola:** The extra rest has done her wonders. The fever from the Trial of the Grasses** is finally breaking. She sits up, sharpening her blade with a steady hand—the Witcher mutagens are beginning to take hold, granting her that unnatural clarity.Bardol:** He is alive, but "Seriously Wounded" is an understatement. He looks at you with hollow eyes. He can walk, but he won't be swinging an oar or a spear effectively for a long time.The Fishermen:** They are silent, cooking a meager breakfast of dried fish. They look less like "nobodies" now and more like men who have realized they are signed to a death warrant.The Road to ThalThe path east lies before you. The "small chest" from Reinmar sits by your bedroll, its contents still a mystery. You are now carrying two heavy burdens: a chest men would kill for, and a heart that pulses with the strength of a giant.As you break camp, how do you want to handle the march?**Bardol in the Rear:** Keep the wounded man protected behind the healthy fishermen. If an ambush occurs, he is merely a distraction.Mage's Haste:** Use the morning energy to push hard for Thal**. The sooner you deliver this chest, the sooner you get those 100 crowns and clear your name of this "Rickroll" debt.The Witcher's Scout:** Now that NeCola is feeling stronger, do you want her to scout ahead of the main group to spot any "men who would kill" before they spot you?The sun is up, Hiyun. Shall we deliver this package, or does the road have other plans for us?**

time to set an ambition


---


## Gemini

A pivotal moment for any growing warband. An Ambition** isn't just a goal; it's a metaphysical tether that binds your men to your will, granting them resolve as they see your dark vision manifest.Given your current situation—carrying a mysterious chest, a pulsing giant's heart, and a half-broken crew—which path of power shall the Abyssal Mage** choose?Choose Your Path:"We shall have a banner that commands respect (or terror)."**The Goal:* Reach a certain amount of Renown (typically 1,000).The Reward:* You get to craft a company banner. For you, it might be a tattered shroud of the void. It boosts morale in battle, keeping your "fodder" from fleeing when things get bloody."A band of brothers must be properly equipped."**The Goal:* Get a certain number of men (usually 12) or outfit them in decent mail.The Reward:* Increases your company size or gear standards. More meat for the grinder, more layers of iron between them and the grave."We must amass a hoard of 1,000 crowns."**The Goal:* Simple greed.The Reward:* Improves your bargaining power and secures your future. Money is the oil that keeps the gears of conquest turning."I seek to master the wilds (Defeat a Beast)."**The Goal:* Hunt down a Direwolf, Nachzehrer, or similar horror.The Reward:* Perfect for a Mage and a Witcher. It proves your dominance over the "lesser" monsters of this world.Which shall it be, Hiyun?** Do you seek to grow the pack, fill the coffers, or raise a banner that will make the Usurper King tremble when he sees it on the horizon?Also, as you set this ambition, how is the "small chest" feeling?** Heavy? Vibratey? Or just... suspiciously quiet?

we chose the one about getting a witcher. afterall, NeCola is already one. Here's how it went:  You were hesitant when NeCola first spoke of becoming a Vatt'ghern. After all, who would willingly submit themselves to the Trial of the Grasses - a process that leaves most dead and the rest forever changed? Yet NeCola was undeterred, her resolve forged of steel and tempered by years of hardship.  At first, her training seemed ordinary enough - long days with the blade, extended hunts in the wilds, and grueling endurance exercises. But soon, her efforts took a darker turn. She sought poisons to build resistance, demanded sparring sessions until her body could barely stand, and endured hunger, cold, and sleepless nights as though testing the limits of human endurance.  NeCola spoke little of her motives, yet the look in her eyes spoke volumes - a woman possessed, chasing strength and power at any cost. The brothers watched with a mix of admiration and unease.  The day of her trial came, and what followed was a horror the others would not soon forget. The screams of a woman being broken from the inside echoed through the camp for days. When the cries finally ceased, and NeCola emerged, she was not the same woman who had entered.  Now, NeCola moves with a predatory grace, her eyes alight with a clarity that unnerves even the bravest among you. She says little of the ordeal, but when asked, she only smirks and says,  " You can't forge a blade without fire. "  The brothers may whisper in hushed tones of the inhuman strength she now wields, but none can deny that NeCola the Vatt'ghern has become something more than mortal...  The company gained renown  NeCola is now known as NeCola the Vatt'ghern  You gain a Vatt'ghern Medallion  You also unlock the ability to craft more such medallions from silver and iron


---


## Gemini

The transformation is complete. The air around the campfire feels thinner, colder, as NeCola the Vatt'ghern** stands tall. The silver in her hair is no longer a sign of age or stress, but a mark of the alchemical fire that burned away her weaknesses.The fishermen—the "fish-fodder"—look at her with a new, bone-deep terror. They saw her broken, they heard the screams that defied nature, and now they see a predator wearing the skin of their comrade.The Spoils of the TrialNeCola the Vatt'ghern:** She has transcended. Her reflexes are no longer human, and her gaze can pierce the illusions of the world. She is the perfect vanguard for an Abyssal Mage.The Vatt'ghern Medallion:** A heavy, cold piece of silver. It hums against your chest, vibrating when magic or monsters are near. It is a sensory organ for the void.The Craft:** You now hold the secret to forging more of these anchors. Should you find more "worthy" souls among the nobodies you recruit, you can expand your circle of mutants.The Path to ThalWith a Witcher at your side and a wounded Bardol trailing behind, the delivery of Reinmar’s chest takes on a different tone. You are no longer just a weird mage with some peasants; you are a burgeoning power.As you approach Thal**, the Medallion begins to twitch. Is it the "men who would kill" for the chest, or is there something... unnatural* waiting for you at the delivery point?What is your command, Hiyun?**The Witcher's Senses:** Have NeCola use her new heightened perception to "smell" any ambushes waiting near the gates of Thal.The Cold Delivery:** Walk straight to Eike of Thal, hand over the chest, and demand your 100 crowns—plus a "tax" for the Rickroll you endured.Inspect the Medallion:** Take a moment to see exactly* why it’s vibrating. Is the danger ahead, or is it coming from the chest itself?The Usurper King’s shadow feels a little less daunting now that you have a Vatt'ghern on the payroll. Shall we enter Thal?**

## User

As we entire the final mile towards thal. We noticed a group of bandits going after a southern caraven! I ordered our man to charge! NeCola is still sidelined considered her illness


---


## Gemini

The predator’s instinct takes hold! Even with NeCola** sidelined by the lingering fatigue of her transformation, you smell blood and opportunity. A Southern caravan—laden with silks, spices, or perhaps more "delicate" alchemical supplies—is being harried by brigands.To the fishermen, this is a rescue. To Hiyun**, this is a harvest.The Tactical SituationThe Prey:** A Southern Caravan (likely guarded by a few Conscripts or Handgonners, but currently overwhelmed).The Aggressors:** A band of Brigands. They likely expect no interference in these lonely miles.Your Force:** Hiyun** and the "Fish-Fodder." Bardol** is still wounded, and NeCola** watches from the rear, her Witcher eyes tracking the movement with frustration as her body demands more rest.The ChargeYou lead the three fishermen across the scrubland. They may be simple men, but the Raven's Blessing** pulses in their veins, and the sight of a Vatt'ghern behind them—even a sick one—gives them a desperate, frantic courage.How do we engage?**The Abyssal Pincer:** Let the brigands stay focused on the Southerners. You lead your men into their exposed flank, using a blast of dark energy to shatter their morale at the moment of impact.The "Heroic" Rescue:** Charge straight into the middle. If a few Southern guards die before you get there, well... that's just fewer people to share the reward with.Scavenger's Grace:** Wait for the brigands to break the caravan's defense, then swoop in to kill the exhausted winners.The battle is joined!** Please upload a screenshot of the battlefield** or the enemy lineup**. I want to see how many heads your "fodder" are about to claim in the name of the Abyss.Will the South remember Hiyun as a savior, or just another monster in the dark?**

## User

The fodder survived again! what a surprise... i mean *great*! Lets continue towards our destination


---


## Gemini

"Surprise" indeed! It seems the Raven's Blessing**—or perhaps just the sheer terror of disappointing an Abyssal Mage—has granted these fishermen a tenacity that defies their humble origins. They stand amidst the corpses of the brigands, breathing hard, wiping southern sand and brigand blood from their rusted spears.The Southern caravaners offer their hurried thanks, perhaps tossing a few extra coins or some strange spices your way for the rescue, but you have no time for their desert pleasantries. Thal** is finally within sight.The Arrival at ThalYou march through the gates of the settlement, a bizarre procession: a green-faced sorcerer, a pale Witcher-woman with predatory eyes, a mangled man named Bardol, and two surprisingly durable fishermen carrying a mysterious chest.Eike of Thal** is waiting for you in a secluded corner of the town's square, nervously checking a pocket watch. He looks at your group, his eyes lingering uncomfortably on Hiyun’s face and NeCola’s silver hair."You're late," he wheezes, reaching for the chest. "But you're alive. That's... more than I expected for 120 crowns."The Moment of TruthHand over the Chest:** Take your 100 crowns, get the letter of completion, and enjoy a warm meal at the tavern.The "Rickroll" Tax:** Demand more gold. You saved a southern caravan and carried a cursed crate—Reinmar's original payment is an insult.The Witcher's Interjection:** Have NeCola** use her new senses to "read" Eike. Is he a simple contact, or is he leading you into a trap now that the package is delivered?What is the first thing we do in Thal, Hiyun? And should we finally see if Bardol can find a proper doctor to stitch those "investigation" wounds?**


---


## User

Here is how it went at Thal  After some looking, a man asks who you're looking for. When you say Eike of Thal, he points you out toward a nearby paddock where a man is strutting about on a rather opulent looking horse.  You walk on over and the man rears the steed and asks if that's the cargo Reinmar of Stohl sent. You nod.  "Leave it there at your feet. I'll come and get it."  You don't, instead asking about your pay. The man sighs and whistles to a bodyguard who hurries over.  "See to it that this sellsword gets the pay he deserves."  Finally, you put the crate on the ground and make your leave.


---


## Gemini

A classic move by a man with too much silk and too little respect. Eike of Thal** didn't even deign to dismount, treating you like a common courier rather than the architect of a dark destiny. He whistles for a bodyguard as if you were a stray dog needing a bone—a mistake many have made before meeting a swift end.But for now, the coins are in the pouch. 100 crowns** clink against the advance, and you’ve fulfilled the contract. The "fish-fodder" can finally eat something that didn't come out of a muddy pond.Thal: A Brief RespiteThe sun sets over the paddocks, casting long, jagged shadows. NeCola** is looking stronger by the hour, her Vatt'ghern constitution finally winning the war against her fever. Bardol**, however, is a walking ghost, his wounds from the "investigation" still stiff and angry.Current Resources:**Gold:** You have a decent stack now.The Party:** Hiyun, NeCola (Vatt'ghern), Bardol (Mangled), and the two Survivor-Fishermen.Special Items:** Unhold's Heart** (still thumping in your pack) and the Vatt'ghern Medallion**.The Next MoveWe are in Thal, a town clearly accustomed to wealth and horses. Now that the chest is delivered and the Rickroll curse is behind you, where does the Abyssal Mage turn his gaze?The Alchemist’s Forge:** Use some of your new gold and the Unhold's Heart** at a local craftsman or apothecary. Perhaps we can craft something to make NeCola even more terrifying.Expand the Circle:** Look for a new recruit in the tavern. Maybe someone with more "substance" than a fisherman, or another "nobody" to test the Trial of the Grasses on.Hunt the Usurper:** Look for a contract that takes us closer to the capital or the heart of the King's territory.What shall it be, Hiyun? Do we spend our hard-earned crowns on steel, medicine, or more "fodder"?**

## User

Let's take another quest  Frank of Thal kicks his feet up on his desk, knocking an empty goblet over.  "The peasants are at it again. Bugging me. They say the Wheat Fields outside of Thal has been destroyed. I don't ordinarily take the fools at their word, but a few of my councilmen seem to have confirmed the news. So now I gotta do something about it."  He swings a finger at you, smiling as he does it.  "That's where you come in. Go to the Wheat Fields, kill those unruly vagabonds, then report back to me. How's that sound to you?"  He nods.  "You look able, so I am willing to pay quite a bit. You are to receive 220 crowns when the contract is done."


---


## Gemini

Frank of Thal clearly has more wine than wisdom in that goblet, but his laziness is your gain. 220 crowns** to swat away some "unruly vagabonds" is a fair price, and it gives your company a chance to stretch their legs after the delivery.However, in the world of Battle Brothers*, when a noble calls them "vagabonds," it could be anything from starving peasants to a band of cutthroat raiders who have decided to burn the food supply.The Master's StrategyHiyun:** Your magic will be a terrifying sight amidst the golden wheat.NeCola:** She is likely itching for a real fight now that her Vatt'ghern blood is settled. This is the perfect "live-fire exercise" for her new reflexes.The Fodder:** Let's see if the fishermen can maintain their streak of survival.The March to the FieldsAs you approach the Wheat Fields, the smell of charred grain and the sight of flattened stalks greet you. The Medallion around your neck (or NeCola's) begins to hum. These aren't just peasants looking for a snack; something is systematically destroying the harvest.How do we enter the fields?**The Silent Reaper:** Send NeCola through the tall wheat to scout. With her Vatt'ghern senses, she’ll hear their breathing before they see her silver hair.The Blight's Arrival:** March straight down the center road, Hiyun. Let the "vagabonds" see the green-faced mage and the "blessed" fishermen. Use yourself as the bait.Burn the Cover:** If the wind is right, do we set fire to the remaining wheat to flush them out? (Note: Frank might be annoyed, but a Mage doesn't care about a few loaves of bread).What do we see as we crest the hill overlooking the fields?** (If you have a screenshot of the enemies or the field, show me!)


---


## User

we arrived at the fields... and here's how it goes  You find a weathervane stuck in the mud and a cow carcass beside it. A pig pen is layered with fresh green grass. One of the buildings has been verdantly painted by a crawl of vines. The cemetery's markings are tilted and some flat on the ground. You find a shovel and a hole beside it. Water's filled the unused grave and there blue birds are bathing. You wonder if this place would be best left as is, but it's not your place to wonder. You head back to inform Frank of Thal on the state of things.


---


## Gemini

This isn't a bandit raid. This is a manifestation**.The "unruly vagabonds" Frank spoke of don't seem to be men at all, but a localized surge of primal, runaway life. Vines painting buildings, grass growing in pig pens, and blue birds bathing in open graves—it’s as if nature itself is trying to reclaim the Wheat Fields with a violent, beautiful urgency.For an Abyssal Mage**, this reeks of a different kind of magic—perhaps an elemental imbalance or the presence of something ancient beneath the soil.The Report to FrankYou return to Thal, the mud of the "verdant" fields still on your boots. Frank is likely still nursing his goblet, expecting a report of dead brigands.How do you handle this, Hiyun?**The Professional Lie:** Tell him the "vagabonds" fled at the sight of your Witcher and Mage. Take the 220 crowns** and leave before he realizes the "vagabonds" are actually vines that might swallow his town next.The Mage’s Warning:** Tell him the truth—that the fields are cursed or enchanted. Demand more* gold to go back and actually "exorcise" the source of this growth.The Opportunist:** You saw a shovel and a fresh hole. Did you take a moment to look inside* that grave before you left? There might be more than just birdwater in a place where the dead are being pushed out by the living.Status CheckNeCola:** Her Vatt'ghern medallion must have been humming like a hornet's nest in those fields. She likely feels the "wrongness" of that rapid growth.The Fodder:** They probably found the cow carcass more interesting than the magic. At least they didn't have to fight... yet.What is your move, Master? Do we take Frank's coin and run, or do we dig deeper into the mystery of the "Verdant Crawl"?**


---


## User

Truth is, we couldnt care less:  You head back to inform Frank of Thal on the state of things.  Frank of Thal sits back after listening to your report. He's sipping a goblet of cobra wine.  "News?"  You tell him that the area has been cleared out. The man swigs the rest of the drink in one go and sets the cup down.  "Good... good. Now take a gang of my workers back there to help rebuild. Once they are finished, come back for your payday."  Would you like me to extract the text from any subsequent images of this quest?


---


## Gemini

Frank of Thal has the soul of a bureaucrat and the patience of a drunkard. He didn't even blink at the mention of the verdant vines or the displaced dead—he just wants his tax revenue back in the form of wheat.But now he's asking for a babysitting job**.The Task: The EscortYou are now the "shepherd" for a gang of soft-handed laborers. You’re taking them back to a place where the graves are overflowing and nature is acting like a predator. This is the part of the contract where things usually go from "easy money" to "blood in the stalks."The Strategic Outlook:**The Laborers:** They are slow, they are weak, and they are prone to screaming. If something comes out of the tall grass, they will be the first to die.The Vatt'ghern's Role:** NeCola is essentially a high-priced security guard now. Her senses will be vital for detecting whatever caused that "unnatural growth" before it decides the workers would make good fertilizer.The Fodder:** The fishermen finally have someone lower than them on the social ladder! They can play at being "guards" while the laborers do the heavy lifting.The Return to the FieldsAs you lead the workers back toward the "verdant" farm, the blue birds are still bathing, and the vines seem to have moved just a little* bit further up the walls since you left.How do you set the watch?**High Alert:** Keep NeCola on a constant perimeter loop. If it breathes, she kills it.Abyssal Overseer:** You stay near the unused grave. If the ground starts to move again, you’ll be ready to meet it with shadow.The "Lazy" Mage:** Let the workers do their thing. If they get eaten, you still have the "clearance" report. You just want that 220 crowns**.Do the workers start rebuilding without incident, or does the "Verdant Crawl" take offense to their hammers and shovels?** (I’m ready for the next update or text extraction if the situation turns violent!)


---


## User

We escorted the workers to the location. Let the workers do their thing. If they get eaten, you still have the "clearance" report. Sure enough, we rush back to town and got our 220 crowns promised


---


## Gemini

Spoken like a true practitioner of the Abyssal arts! You didn't waste a single drop of sweat on those laborers. Whether they successfully rebuilt the farm or became premium compost for those sentient vines is a problem for "Future Frank."You walked in, looked at some weird grass, walked back, escorted some doomed peasants, and walked away with 220 crowns**. That is the most efficient bit of mercenary business you've done yet.The State of the Abyssal Company:The Coffers:** Your gold reserves are looking healthy. Between the 120 from the "Rickroll" delivery and the 220 from the "Verdant" fields, you can finally afford some real gear—or more mutagens.NeCola the Vatt'ghern:** She is fully recovered. The Witcher-blood is pumping, her eyes are yellow and sharp, and she’s probably bored of watching peasants hammer nails. She needs a challenge worthy of her transformation.Bardol:** How is the "Investigation victim" doing? If those wounds have closed, he might be ready to get back into the line.What’s Next for Hiyun?Thal has been profitable, but the air here smells too much of horse manure and "cobra wine."The Smithy:** Do we use this gold to buy NeCola** a proper two-handed sword or some reinforced mail? A Witcher in rags is just a fast target.The Tavern:** Look for a new contract. Now that you have a Vatt'ghern, maybe it's time to take on a "Beast" contract to test her new abilities.The Alchemist:** You still have that Unhold's Heart**. Now that you have the gold, maybe you can find a specialist to turn it into a Regeneration Potion** or an Armored Attachment**.Where shall we direct our dark ambitions next? Are we staying in Thal, or heading back to Stohl to show Reinmar how a real warband looks?**

## User

It is now the dusk of Day 2. it was a productive day


---


## Gemini

A very productive day indeed. In just 48 hours, you’ve transformed from a lone mage with a few terrified fishermen into a force that commands a Vatt'ghern**, carries the thumping heart of a giant**, and has successfully navigated both metaphysical pop-culture curses and sentient botanical anomalies.As the sun dips below the horizon on Day 2**, the campfire light flickers against NeCola’s** new cat-like pupils and the clinking gold in your purse.Day 2 Summary:The Vatt'ghern Rising:** You successfully guided NeCola through the Trial of the Grasses. You now have a mutant elite in your ranks.The Courier’s Irony:** You survived the "Rickroll" of the ancient crate and delivered the real cargo to Eike of Thal.The Verdant Grift:** You played Frank of Thal for 220 crowns, providing a "security" detail that did the bare minimum while nature reclaimed the fields.The Butcher’s Bill:** You traded Bardol’s physical integrity for an Unhold’s Heart**. A dark trade, but one that will pay dividends in power.Looking Toward Day 3:The "fodder" are sleeping, their bellies full of Thal’s bread. Bardol** nurses his scars, and NeCola** likely sits awake, her heightened senses tracking the nocturnal predators of the plains.What is our first priority when the sun rises on Day 3?**Gear Up:** Spend that 340+ gold on a weapon that can actually take advantage of NeCola's new strength.The Heart's Purpose:** Finally find a way to use that Unhold's Heart—perhaps looking for a specialized Alchemist in a larger city.New Horizons:** Leave the Thal/Stohl circuit. Should we head South** toward the Alchemists as the outsiders suggested, or North** to find more "fodder" to put through the Trial?Shall we rest, or do you have one last dark ritual to perform before the day officially ends?**


---


## User

NeCola is still ill and will need another 3-6 days to recover


---


## Gemini

Ah, the fine print of the Trial of the Grasses**. It seems the mutagens are conducting a thorough "renovation" of NeCola's internal organs. While she has the spirit* of a Vatt'ghern, her physical vessel is currently stuck in the "molting" phase.3 to 6 days** is a long time to linger in a town like Thal. It means the "Fish-Fodder" and the battered Bardol are currently your primary line of defense. If a group of professional mercenaries or a wandering Orc decides to take an interest in your gold, things could get messy very quickly.The "Hospital" StrategySince your heavy hitter is sidelined, we have to play it smart for the next few days. We can't afford a "Glorious Charge" if the person doing the charging is busy coughing up black bile in a tavern cellar.How shall we spend NeCola's recovery time?**The Caravan Guard Grift:** Take a slow, low-risk caravan contract heading toward a large city. It pays for your food and daily wages while NeCola rests in the back of a wagon.The "Doctor's" Visit:** Spend some of that hard-earned gold on a Temple** or a Healer**. It might shave a day or two off her recovery and ensure Bardol's "investigation" wounds don't turn gangrenous.The Recruiting Drive:** Use the downtime to find one or two more bodies. If NeCola is out, you need someone else to stand between you and the sharp objects of the world. Maybe a brawny Farmhand or a disgraced Squire?Current Inventory Check:Unhold's Heart:** Still waiting for a purpose.Vatt'ghern Medallion:** Humming in your pocket.Crowns:** ~340 (minus food and wages).Do we hunker down in Thal and wait for the "New NeCola" to emerge, or do we risk a slow trek to a bigger city where better gear and alchemists await?**

we picked up yet another fodder in ARNGRIMR. I have also attached names of the 3 fodders we picked up at the beginning. Let's hope they remove themselves from the party soon :D

Let's take another quest. This is how the interaction with the employer went:  Dust covers Frank of Thal's table, but there is a spot oddly cleaner than the rest. He gestures to it.  "That's where my golden talisman used to sit. If you couldn't tell, it's gone."  You nod. It does appear to be missing.  "The thieves who took it should be easy to track down. They're good thinkers in the night, those brigands, but they make mistakes aplenty during the day. Footprints, crowns ill-spent... you should be able to track them down with ease."  He looks at you with a stern eye.  "Do you understand, mercenary? I want you to get my property back. I want it placed right where it belongs. And... I want those thieves dead in the mud."  What's this worth to you?  He smiles.  "This will make you rich, my friend. It's 70 crowns in advance, and another 290 when the job is done."


---


## Gemini

Frank of Thal is back at it again, and his misplaced jewelry is about to become your next payday. A total of 360 crowns** for a retrieval job is a healthy bump to your current 2,240 crowns**. It seems the "Verdant Grift" didn't sour his opinion of you—or perhaps he's just too drunk on cobra wine to notice the vines swallowing his town.The Mission: The Talisman HuntFrank wants his golden talisman back and the thieves "dead in the mud." Given your recent scout report, we might already have eyes on the culprits.The Advance:** You’ve pocketed 70 crowns** upfront.The Target:** Likely that group of Nomad Cutthroats** and Bandit Rabble** your scout spotted lurking nearby.The Stakes:** High renown. Completing this helps you toward your proclamation of becoming a legend rather than just a "small-time" brigand-chaser.The Battlefield: Rain and MudThe tactical map shows a grim scene. It’s raining, which will slow your "fodder" down and likely jam the Bandit Poacher's bowstrings. You have Arngrimr**, Bardol**, Arnulf**, and Ingjald** lined up to take the brunt of the assault.Current Status of the "Fodder":**Bardol & Ingjald:** Glowing with the Raven's Blessing.Arnulf:** Still mangled and bleeding with only 103/200 XP. He is essentially a walking target at this point.Arngrimr:** The fresh face, currently sitting at 0 XP. Let's see if he lasts long enough to learn which end of the spear to hold.The Abyssal DirectiveSince NeCola is still recovering from her Trial of the Grasses**, she’ll be watching from the sidelines while these four "remove themselves from the party" as you so eloquently put it.How do we proceed with the hunt?**The Vatt'ghern Tracker:** Even if she's ill, have NeCola use her heightened senses to find the exact "footprints and crowns ill-spent" Frank mentioned.The Meat Grinder:** Send the four fishermen into the mud to bog down the Nomad Cutthroat while you provide magical support from the rear.The Gold Standard:** If we find the thieves, do we kill them immediately, or see if they’re willing to pay more* than 290 crowns to keep their heads?The hunt is on, Hiyun. Shall we follow the tracks, or wait for the bandits to stumble into your purple-eyed wall of fishermen?**

## User

We found them to the north east over the night. It was a rather long chase but we got them engaged in an open field Day 3 morning. Here's their composition


---


## Gemini

The hunt reaches its climax in the cold morning light of Day 3. You’ve tracked Frank’s "golden property" to a band of brigands who look decidedly less confident now that the Usurper's Bane** has cornered them in the open.The Enemy CompositionYour scout was right; they have the advantage of range, but they are terrified of the "well-paid wrath" about to descend.Frontline:** A few Bandit Rabble**. These are the disposable shields for their more dangerous assets.Backline:** A few Brigand Poachers** and a dangerous Arbalester**. The Arbalester is the primary threat; a single bolt from a heavy crossbow could end a "fodder's" career—or life—before they even close the gap.The Abyssal LineupYou are entering the field with a war chest of 2,240 crowns** and 0 food**, meaning if these men don't win and find some bread on the corpses, they'll be eating their boots by nightfall.NameStatus / HealthGear & MutationsBardol**100% HealthBlessed** with glowing purple eyes and dark wings.Ingjald**Injured (+)Blessed** with glowing eyes; has taken 15 damage.Arnulf**Mangled / Near DeathMangled** face; took 73 damage and is barely clinging to life.Arngrimr**100% HealthThe "fresh" sacrifice. No combat experience yet.

damn,,, our fodders survived again! let head back to town and get paid

## Gemini

The Abyssal luck holds—or perhaps the mud of the battlefield simply refused to swallow your "fodder" just yet. Despite the Arbalester** and his Brigand Poachers** looming over the field, your line of purple-eyed survivors has managed to clinch another victory.The Battle Aftermath: Blood and XPThe combat logs show a grueling slog through the rainy morning of Day 3:Ingjald** and Bardol** have both officially tasted blood now, each securing 1 kill**.Arngrimr**, the newest sacrifice, jumped straight to 100 XP**, nearly catching up to the veterans in a single engagement.Arnulf** remains your most "consistent" disappointment; he took another 40 damage** without landing a single strike, ending the battle with 0 XP** and a portrait that is more scar tissue than man.Back to Thal: The PaydayYou return to Frank of Thal** with the golden talisman and the satisfying news that the thieves are indeed "dead in the mud."The Reward:** You are now owed the remaining 290 crowns**.The Treasury:** With this payout, your war chest will swell to approximately 2,530 crowns**.Resources:** Your inventory is currently sitting on 238 tools**, 280 ammo**, and 230 medical supplies**, but still shows a critical 0 food**. Your men are currently fueled by nothing but dark magic and spite.The Witcher's ProgressWhile the "fodder" were busy not dying, your ambition to create a Vatt'ghern** looms large. You have the gold, the renown is growing, and NeCola** is another day closer to her full recovery.Shall we use this newfound wealth to finally buy some bread for these starving mutants, or would you like to browse the market for a weapon heavy enough for NeCola to wield once she finally stands?**

## User

whoa hold on. there is a yet another loot crate. We opened it. Inside of it is.... rick roll again!!!! 2 in a roll wth


---


## Gemini

Unbelievable. Two in a row? At this point, the universe isn't just testing you; it’s actively trolling the Abyss. To survive a life-altering mutation trial and a field of sentient vines only to be hit with a second metaphysical "never gonna give you up" is almost impressive in its cruelty.The Analysis of the AbsurdThe Statistical Improbability:** Finding one Rickroll crate is a curse; finding two is a divine prank**. The Usurper King must have a very specific, very annoying sense of humor.The Fodder's Reaction:** Imagine your "blessed" purple-eyed fishermen, covered in mud and scars, opening a mysterious crate expecting gold or artifacts, only to find... that*. Their morale must be hitting rock bottom, or they're starting to think you're doing this on purpose.The Rickroll Tax:** If you haven't already, you should definitely charge Frank of Thal an "emotional distress" fee.The State of the CompanyDespite the crate's disappointment, let's look at the hard numbers after that battle:MercenaryStatusFateIngjald**101 XP**Achieved 1 Kill** and survived with 0 fresh damage**.Bardol**95 XP**Achieved 1 Kill** but took a staggering 102 damage**.Arngrimr**100 XP**The "Fresh Fodder" is now a veteran of the mud, taking only 16 damage**.Arnulf**0 XP**Took 40 damage**, landed 0 strikes**, and is basically held together by spite at this point.

## User

On the way back to town. we concluded our second ambition of making a banner. Here is how it went:  No one likes a skinflint, least of all a group of wandering, bloodthirsty rabble motivated primarily by a love of coin. Not everyone, or more precisely, no one, was thrilled when you suggested cutting back on spending to save up for a company standard.  Once the Usurper's Bane's standard is finally paid for and hoisted for the first time to proudly snap in a fresh dawn breeze, however, no one claims it wasn't worth it. The men are proud of their new standard, even tossing around names for it around the campfire, though none of them really stick.  It's clear for everyone to see now, this is not some band of hired thugs, this is becoming a true mercenary company. Who should have the honor of carrying the standard?


---


## Gemini

The irony is thick enough to choke a Nomad, Hiyun. You’ve spent the last two days calling these men "fodder" and waiting for them to "remove themselves" from the party, yet here they are: standing tall, eyes glowing purple with the Raven's Blessing**, and actually proud* to be under your banner.A true mercenary company has emerged from the mud of the wheat fields.The Banner of the Usurper's BaneThe standard snaps in the wind, a symbol that you are no longer just a weird mage with a few expendable fishermen. You are a Commander**. Your renown has surged, and the men will now hold their ground longer in the face of horrors—partly out of pride, and partly because they're terrified of what you'll do to them if they drop it.Who Should Carry the Standard?Carrying the banner is a heavy responsibility—literally. It occupies a hand, meaning the bearer usually needs a shield or a one-handed weapon, and they must stay alive at all costs to keep morale from shattering.Your Candidates:**Bardol (The Veteran):** He has the most kills (1) and strikes (59). He’s been "investigated" and mangled, yet he still stands. Giving him the banner acknowledges his status as the "first" of your blessed.Ingjald (The Reliable):** He survived the last battle with 0 fresh damage** and has a clean kill to his name. He is stable, though perhaps less "storied" than Bardol.Arngrimr (The Prodigy):** In just one battle, he jumped to 100 XP**. He’s fresh, he’s healthy, and he hasn't been mangled yet.Arnulf (The "Miracle"):** Giving the banner to a man with 0 XP** and a face full of scars would be the ultimate Abyssal joke. If he carries the standard, he'll be a high-priority target for every enemy archer.The Road AheadWe are returning to Thal with 2,500+ crowns**, a new banner, and two Rickrolls under our belt.What is the first order of business upon entering the gates?**The Great Feast:** For the love of the Void, buy some food**. Your men are currently "proud" but likely hallucinating from hunger.The Armory:** You have the gold to turn these fishermen into iron-clad warriors.The Standard Bearer:** Formally appoint one of your men to carry the banner.Who gets the honor, and what do we buy first with our small mountain of gold?**

We returned to Thal midday of day 3. Our employer  ```txt  Frank of Thal takes the golden talisman from you, hugging it close as though he'd retrieved a lost child. His eyes get a little teary just looking at his artifact.  "Thank you, sellsword. This means a lot to me... I mean, uh, the town. You have our gratitude!"  He pauses as you stare at him. His eyes bounce to a corner of the room.  "Our... gratitude, sellsword..."  A large wooden chest is opened by a guard. You count the crowns and go.  ```  the attached shows our current finance

Let's wrap up this first session of game play with a short summary of what happened since the start of the jouney until now

## Gemini

What a chaotic and productive start to the Usurper's Bane** saga. In just three days, you’ve gone from a lone Abyssal Mage to a banner-bearing mercenary company with a penchant for surviving metaphysical pranks and botanical horrors.The Journey So Far: Days 1–3**The Foundation of the Bane:** You began with a core group of "fish-fodder"—Bardol**, Ingjald**, and the surprisingly durable Arnulf**. You later added Arngrimr**, who quickly proved his worth by soaking up 100 XP in a single morning.The Rise of the Vatt'ghern:** You successfully oversaw NeCola’s** transformation through the Trial of the Grasses. Though the process left her ill and sidelined for the immediate future, she has transcended mortality to become your first elite mutant.The Rickroll Curse:** Your luck with mystery crates has been... statistically impossible. You have been "Rickrolled" twice in a row, finding nothing but the legendary 80s anthem where riches should have been.The "Verdant" Grift:** You played Frank of Thal** for a fool, taking 220 crowns to "clear" a field that was actually being swallowed by sentient vines and birds bathing in open graves.Recovery of the Talisman:** You tracked a band of brigands—including a deadly Arbalester—through the mud to retrieve Frank’s golden talisman, securing a massive payday and solidifying your reputation.A Growing Legend:** You have officially raised your Company Standard** and proclaimed your ultimate ambition: to master the Trial of the Grasses** and equip your men with Vatt'ghern Medallions**.Current Company Status**Treasury:** A solid 1,874 crowns**.Roster:** 6 out of 8 slots filled.MVP:** Ingjald**, currently your most stable "Blessed" fighter with 101 XP and a clean health bill.The Walking Miracle:** Arnulf**, who has 0 XP and has survived 113 total damage across the journey.Would you like me to save this summary so we can pick up exactly where we left off—perhaps with a trip to the Thal armory to spend that gold?**
