Session 9 HERE WE GO! We resume at Ohnemenschen. We continue north towards KOCHENDORF A prospering village surrounded by fertile land. The market is usually filled with all kinds of fresh food.

## Gemini

Northward Bound: The Road to KochendorfThe gates of Ohnemenschen** creak shut behind you as the company sets its sights north. The rugged terrain begins to soften, giving way to the rolling greens and tilled soil of the central heartlands.The air smells of damp earth and blooming crops. After days of meager rations and salt-dried meat, the promise of Kochendorf** hangs over the men like a morale boost. They say the village is prospering—which usually means the wine is cheap, the bread is soft, and the contracts are plenty.Current StatusLocation:** Moving North towards Kochendorf.Environment:** Fertile farmland, clear roads.Party Mood:** Anticipatory.As the thatched roofs of the village appear on the horizon, the brothers tighten their belts and shoulder their gear. The market square ahead looks bustling, even from this distance.How do you want to approach the village?** We can head straight for the Marketplace** to resupply, check the Tavern** for rumors, or head to the Village Elder** to see if any contracts are pinned to the board.

Just outside of Ohnemenschen, we spotted a small group of 7 BRIGANDS A rough and tough band of raiders preying on the weak.  Some Bandit Rabble, A Bandit Rabble Poacher, A Possessed Arbalester. We of course would not let them live. AH! Juicy experience points.  ---  VICTORY  The enemy was destroyed in 4 rounds  Statistics Loot  | Name | Kills | Damage Dealt | XP Gained | Damage Taken |  |---|---|---|---|---|  | HIYUN | 0 | 0 | XP 36 | 0 |  | NECOLA THE SILVER SWORD | 1 | 230 | XP 76 | 0 |  | WILFRIED B | 0 | 0 | XP 36 | 0 |  | ABANOUB E IBN MANSUR | 0 | 0 | XP 27 | 0 |  | IMAMADDIN E REACH FLAIL | 1 | 30 | XP 32 | 0 |  | HARUN D AL-BAJI | 1 | 85 | XP 30 | 7 |  | FRETHWI A | 0 | 19 | XP 27 | 0 |  | FRESSENDA | 1 | 48 | XP 31 | 0 |  | GODFREY D | 0 | 0 | XP 26 | 0 |  | SORREL F | 1 | 33 | XP 44 | 0 |  | THEUDEBALD F | 0 | 0 | XP 27 | 59 |  | HILTRUDE | 1 | 98 | XP 32 | 0 |  ---

## Gemini

Victory on the RoadShort-lived was the brigands' ambition! They thought they found prey, but they only found their graves. In just four rounds, the company systematically dismantled the raiders. Necola the Silver Sword** led the charge with a devastating 230 damage, while the rest of the line held firm, ensuring the Possessed Arbalester** didn't cause any lasting havoc.The skirmish served as a perfect warm-up for the road ahead. Aside from Theudebald F** taking a significant hit to his armor (or skin), the company emerges largely unscathed and a bit more experienced.Battle AftermathThe MVP:** Necola the Silver Sword** with a clean kill and massive damage output.Wounded:** Theudebald F** (59 damage taken) and Harun D Al-Baji** (minor scrapes).Status:** The road to Kochendorf** is now slightly safer—and your pockets slightly heavier.With the blood cleaned from your blades and the crows descending on the "Bandit Rabble," the fertile fields of Kochendorf** finally loom close.Would you like to stop to repair Theudebald's gear before entering the village, or shall we head straight into the market to see what rewards your victory might buy?**

This time for real - we continue north. We camped on the road for dinner and a quick rest on Day 26 night. That's when we encountered:  ---  The men are talking around the campfire when Wilfried B suddenly jumps to his feet screaming. He bounds backward, and lit by the flames you see a spider the size of a helmet glommed onto his boot!  "Burn it in the fire!" Necola yelled. She is surprisingly scared of spiders... Gigantic ones we fight are fine but not the normal spider????  Wilfried B nods and stiffly walks toward the campfire with the spiderling looking up at him with oddly trusting eyes. He puts the critter to the pit and it is immediately set ablaze. At first, you think he's done it, he's in the clear, but the fiery spiderling sprints up the man's pantleg, setting his attire alight, and gloms onto his head. Set afire, the man throws his hands out and begins to run around for help. The beast burrows its fangs into his skull and the screaming ceases in sudden paralysis and the sellsword falls into the campfire like a board of wood.  What a freak accident... or is it?  You scream at the mercenaries to do their part, but when you jump toward the campfire and Wilfried B there's a wash of embers and sparks and when they fade you find the sellsword calmly sitting beside the flames.  "Ah, captain, did you say something?"  Looking around, you find the rest of the company engaged in idle chat. When you look back at Wilfried B you thought you saw a white shadow passing behind him, but upon second glance it is gone. You tell the men to keep a vigilant eye for intruders and then return to your tent.  Looks like i needed more rest...  ---

## Gemini

A Fever Dream in the DarkThe crackle of the campfire usually brings comfort, but tonight it brought a waking nightmare. The sight of Wilfried B** transformed into a human torch by a tiny, "trusting" spider was vivid enough to make your skin crawl. Necola’s** sudden phobia and the smell of burning hair felt all too real—until the embers cleared.Finding Wilfried B sitting there, perfectly intact and utterly confused by your shouting, is a jarring reminder of the toll the road takes on a Captain’s mind. Or perhaps, as that white shadow suggests, something more ethereal is stalking the company's periphery.Night Watch ReportMorale:** Shaken (for you, at least). The men seem oblivious.Casualties:** None (physical). Wilfried B is alive and well, if a bit puzzled.Observation:** A "white shadow" sighted. Could be exhaustion... or a lingering presence.The sun rises on Day 27**. The nightmares of the night fade as the morning mist lifts, revealing the sturdy palisades and bustling outskirts of Kochendorf**. The smell of fresh bread from the village ovens is a welcome replacement for the smell of phantom smoke.Would you like to head to the marketplace to stock up on that fresh food, or go straight to the village center to see if anyone has seen any "white shadows" or has work for a band of seasoned mercenaries?**

Just outside of Kochendorf...  ---  The forests of the north are a primeval place, the span of a life is measured in months and the climate is a perpetual state of autumn or winter where the wildlife is as deadly as the weather. Leaving the town to walk through these forests is humbling - the trees here have outlived but the gods themselves, or so some would say. Your thoughts begin to wander further as the bridle path begins to feel endless and the trees curl inwards. The pressure builds in your head as you fall to the ground. The brush parts for a woman clad in furs holding a staff, focusing intently on you as you try to regain your balance. The noise stops and your mind clears. The woman speaks.  "Why are you here, outsider?"  Her brow furrows and she hums, but her lips part again.  "I know what you are, and I know what you have done. Not just in this life - but the ones that have come before."  Her gaze lifts as she loses focus with you and looks down the path, deep in contemplation. The weight in your mind begins to lift as a tide ebbs before it comes crashing back. However, as she fixes her gaze with yours, the wave doesn't come crashing back. It is still there, at the back of your head - restrained like a warhound on a chain.  "Something is changing outsider - something is coming that we can't stand alone and face. I do not care for your work, your motivations or hardships. I care about stopping the cataclysm of what is to come." "Welcome to the Usurper's Bane," I said.  ---  We've got ourselves a Vala and her name is Maike. She is a travelling seer, shaman and sorceress. Besides the ability to inscribe objects with magical rune sigils she also knows sorcerous incantations in the form of chants, and can induce trance states through which she may perceive and interact with the spirit world and the spirits therein.


---


## Gemini

The Seer Joins the FoldThe air grows heavy and the woods turn silent as Maike** steps from the shadows of the ancient northern timber. Her words cut through the mundane concerns of crowns and contracts, reaching back into lives you barely remember. She isn't here for gold or glory; she is here for the Usurper's Bane** and the storm that gathers on the horizon.With her arrival, the company gains more than just a fighter. You now have a Vala**—a mistress of runes and spirits who can bolster your gear with sigils and command the very essence of the battlefield through her chants.New Companion: Maike the ValaRole:** Seer, Shaman, and Runesmith.Abilities:** Rune Inscription (Equipment Buffs) and Spiritual Chants.Origin:** The primeval northern forests.The men give her a wide berth, whispering about the spirits that seem to dance at the edge of her staff. Even Necola**, usually the first to speak her mind, looks on with a newfound sense of gravity. The "white shadow" from your campfire dream suddenly feels much more significant with a spirit-talker now among your ranks.Kochendorf** is now just a stone's throw away. With Maike's arrival, the stakes of your journey have shifted from simple merc work to something far more ancient.Would you like to enter Kochendorf and see if the Vala needs specific supplies for her inscriptions, or shall we look for a contract to test her chants in live combat?**

As usual, we went looking for jobs the first thing in town.  ---  Hugues the Guild Master greets you with a worried expression on his face.  "I'm glad you're here, sellsword. We've been receiving reports of dangerous beasts appearing around the outskirts of our town."  You look around you, noticing the townsfolk going about their business completely oblivious to the precarious situation their lives are in.  "Thankfully, nothing terrible has happened ... yet. With your help, we can make sure that it stays that way."  He opens the palm of his hands.  "I'm tight on crowns, so before you ask, this is all I have right now. You'll be paid 160 crowns in advance, and another 640 when the job is done."  ---  We found ourselves up against a huge group of NACHZEHRERS. A flock of scavenging nachzehrers: An Armored Wiederganger, 20 Nachzehrers, A Brigand Raider.  This time, no cheese tactics needed.  ---  VICTORY  The enemy retreated after 6 rounds  Statistics Loot  | Name | Kills | Injuries | XP | Morale |  |---|---|---|---|---|  | HIYUN | 1 | 0 | 243 | 35 |  | NECOLA THE SILVER SWORD | 6 | 1301 | 286 | 0 |  | WILFRIED B | 1 | 103 | 243 | 0 |  | ABANOUB E IBN MANSUR | 0 | 156 | 164 | 0 |  | IMAMADDIN E REACH FLAIL | 2 | 85 | 206 | 0 |  | HARUN D AL-BAJI | 3 | 152 | 187 | 64 |  | FRETHWI A | 1 | 83 | 185 | 0 |  | FRESSENDA | 1 | 182 | 201 | 0 |  | GODFREY D | 1 | 120 | 181 | 0 |  | SORREL F | 1 | 105 | 185 | 0 |  | THEUDEBALD F | 1 | 152 | 185 | 0 |  | HILTRUDE | 0 | 0 | 164 | 0 |  | MAIKE | 0 | 0 | 190 | 0 |

## Gemini

The Cleansing of KochendorfGuild Master Hugues wasn't exaggerating—that wasn't just a "dangerous beast" sighting, it was a full-blown infestation. Twenty Nachzehrers** and their undead and brigand hangers-on are enough to swallow a village whole if left unchecked.The battle was a masterclass in holding the line. Necola the Silver Sword** was a whirlwind of steel, accounting for six kills and an astronomical 1,301 damage**. The scavengers tried to feast, but your brothers were faster, denying them the chance to grow. Maike** watched from the ranks, her first taste of the company's steel in action as she earned her share of the XP.Contract Success: Beast SlayersPerformance:** Total victory in 6 rounds. The survivors fled back into the shadows.Standout:** Necola** (6 Kills) and Harun D Al-Baji** (3 Kills).Payment:** 160 crowns (Advance) + 640 crowns (Completion) = 800 Crowns total.**With the threat neutralized, the "precarious situation" Hugues feared has passed. The men return to Kochendorf caked in the foul black blood of the ghouls, but with heavy purses. The market is still open, and the tavern fire is surely roaring.How shall we spend the Guild Master's gold?** We can hit the Market** for supplies and perhaps some fresh food for a victory feast, or head to the Tavern** to boost morale and listen for more rumors of the "cataclysm" Maike spoke of.

We returned to the village.  ---  You find Hugues the Guild Master resting on his laurels. He stands and pulls his pants up, a servant quickly retrieving a bucket from whence he was sitting. The poor servant quickly rushes out of the room. Hugues the Guild Master points at the Nachzehrer head dangling from your hand.  "That is absolutely disgusting. Esben, give the Usurper's Bane their pay. 800 crowns, was it?"  ---


---


## Gemini

Gold in Hand, Gore on the FloorThe sight of Hugues** and his "bucket" is enough to make a man lose his appetite for that fresh Kochendorf bread, but the sound of 800 crowns** clinking into your purse is the perfect palate cleanser. The Guild Master might be a bit uncouth, but his coin is good, and the village of Kochendorf** is officially safe from the scavenging tide.Maike** stands at the back of the group, her eyes fixed on the retreating servant and the foul trophy in your hand. She seems indifferent to the gold, her gaze lingering instead on the brothers, measuring how they carry themselves after such a slaughter.Current LogisticsTreasury:** +640 Crowns (Final payment received).Inventory:** One "absolutely disgusting" Nachzehrer head and a company full of blood-stained gear.Location:** Kochendorf Guild Hall.The job is done and the sun is beginning to dip. Kochendorf’s market is famous for its variety, and the men are surely looking to wash the taste of ghoul blood out of their mouths.Would you like me to help you look for some high-quality gear in the market now that you're flush with cash, or shall we check the tavern to see if the "white shadow" or Maike's prophecies have any of the locals talking?**

In the village, we found Lady Amelia. Lady Amelia is a SWORDMASTER. She is considered to be one of the most dangerous swordswoman to have ever walked the earth. A story goes that her family was murdered and she knew not by whom. Wanting to be ready if she came across those responsible, she taught herself to be good enough with a blade to kill anyone. Legend has it that she quarreled with a foul beast of monstrous proportions. He waves the notion away with a fingerless hand and a scarred wink. The man has been robbed of her athleticism, but her knowledge has turned swordfighting into mathematics.  With her help we will be able to fight much greater foe.  We were also offered a job  ---  Raginari of Kochendorf stands by the window, watching rain streak the glass before turning to you.  "There's an old estate further out of town - burned, broken, and cursed by the look of it. Travelers swear they hear wailing within, and those foolish enough to enter are found days later, pale and twisted, if at all. I sent men to see what truth there was in it ... now they're part of the tale themselves."  He exhales, weary but resolute.  "I've neither the men nor the stomach to face what haunts that ruin. But I've heard your company travels with a vatt'ghern - a rare breed, skilled in dealing with such filth. Send them to cleanse the estate and bring proof the curse is lifted. Do this, and you'll have coin, gratitude, and safer roads for it."  She puts her hand on your shoulder, smiling reaffirmingly.  "I think I know an adequate compensation for your services. You'll be paid 1390 crowns in advance, and another 5570 when the job is done."  BANDIT'S REST  I accept your offer. We need to be paid more for this. We need more payment in advance. We need more payment once the work is done. Forget it, this isn't worth it.  ---

## Gemini

The Swordmaster and the Haunted EstateKochendorf has certainly become a pivot point for the Usurper's Bane**. First a Vala, and now Lady Amelia**. Having a Swordmaster of her caliber—one who has turned the art of the duel into pure mathematics—elevates your frontline from mere mercenaries to a surgical strike force. Her scarred wink says more than a thousand boasts could; she has seen the worst the world has to offer and cut its head off.Then there is Raginari**. The mention of a "vatt'ghern" (Witcher) in your ranks caught his attention. He isn't asking for a simple bandit cull; he's asking you to walk into a nightmare at Bandit's Rest**. The reward is staggering: a total of 6,960 crowns**. That kind of coin usually means half the company won't be coming back to spend it.The Contract: Bandit's RestObjective:** Cleanse the cursed estate.The Threat:** "Wailing," "pale and twisted" victims—likely Geists, Alps, or worse.The Pay:** 1,390 Crowns (Advance) / 5,570 Crowns (Completion).The rain streaks the glass as you weigh the gold against the lives of your men. With Maike** to ward off spirits and Lady Amelia** to tutor your blades, you have never been better prepared for a "cursed" location. However, the mention of "pale and twisted" bodies suggests this isn't a simple haunting.You've accepted the offer, but how do you want to handle the negotiations?** * Take the 1,390 now** and head out before the rain gets worse?Push for more coin** (in advance or total) given the legendary status of your new recruits?Would you like me to check your roster's current equipment** to see if Lady Amelia or Maike need specific tools from the market before facing the "wailing" within the ruin?

We headed east into the woods around the village to Purge Remote Graveyard of Geists. The REMOTE GRAVEYARD was a place where people have buried their dead, placing them down for their last rest. Or at least they hoped so. The fight over it was nothing easy.  ---  While approaching the ruins, you can feel the supernatural, the chilling presence of the aetherium. You are not about to just fight mere spirits, but proper geists, possessing weapons, entire suits of armor ... and people, as some of your men point out, in a terrified fashion. They most likely are of the lost patrol, or even mercenaries, that tried - and failed, quite obviously - to put this place to rest.  You keep calm, and remember that you have a vatt'ghern on your side. Make good use of him. Tools like holy water, and skills that could consecrate the undead could prove very practical too.  You prepare to give the order ...  ---  We were up against 13 enemies, including 5 possessed noble army men - one of them a champion -, a sword geist and an amour geist, 2 normal geist, a hell hound, a barbarian, and a champion southern slinger


---


## Gemini

The Nightmare at Remote GraveyardThe air at the Remote Graveyard** doesn't just feel cold; it feels wrong*. The aetherium is thick here, a sickly pressure that makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up. Seeing the "lost patrol" standing there—noble army men now reduced to possessed husks—is a grim warning of what happens to those who underestimate the dead.Among the ranks of the damned stands a Champion** of the noble house and a Champion Southern Slinger**, their movements jerky and unnatural under the influence of the geists. With a Sword Geist** and an Armor Geist** ready to shred through your defenses, this is a fight where steel alone might not be enough.The Opposition: 13 Spectral & Possessed FoesThe Possessed:** 5 Noble Army Men (1 Champion) - Tough, disciplined, and now tireless.The Spirits:** 2 Normal Geists, 1 Sword Geist, 1 Armor Geist - The true architects of the horror.The Hounds & Outcasts:** 1 Hell Hound, 1 Barbarian, 1 Champion Southern Slinger.The men are looking to you—and to your vatt'ghern**. The presence of the Witcher is the only thing keeping the "terrified fashion" of the men from turning into a full-blown rout before the first blow is even struck.How shall we engage this unholy assembly?**Unleash the Vatt'ghern:** Have him lead the charge with oils or silver to disrupt the geists.Maike’s Warding:** Have the Vala chant to steady the men's resolve against the Geists' horrific screams.Target the Champions:** Direct Lady Amelia** or Necola** to duel the possessed Noble Champion to break the enemy's formation.How would you like to deploy your specialists for this encounter?**

We won but not without a cost... THEUDEBALD and HILTRUDE were both downed. The former was zommbified and the later... well let's just say we didnt manage to find all the bits and pieces of her head to stitch together.

## Gemini

A Pyrrhic Victory at the GraveyardThe silence that follows the eleventh round is heavy and bitter. You’ve purged the Remote Graveyard, but the Usurper's Bane** has paid in blood and soul.Hiltrude** is gone—a messy, violent end that even a surgeon couldn't undo. But the fate of Theudebald F** is perhaps more harrowing. The aetherium took him, and while his heart has stopped, his body still moves. He is no longer the brother you knew, but a hollow, shambling Wiederganger**. You’ve decided to keep him as "fodder"—a grim reminder of the graveyard's cost, and a meat-shield for the living.Battle Report: The Toll of the DeadThe Fallen:** Hiltrude** (KIA - Total body failure).The Fallen (Sort of):** Theudebald F** (Zombified).The Survivors:** * Necola the Silver Sword** was a titan again, dealing 1,256 damage**, but she nearly met her end, taking 239 damage**. She is hanging by a thread.Sorrel F** and Frethwi A** are also badly battered, both having looked into the abyss and barely blinked back.Lady Amelia** showed her "mathematical" precision, dealing solid damage while barely being touched (8 damage taken**).The "proof" Raginari asked for is likely sitting in your bags, though the sight of a zombified Theudebald might be more proof than the village can stomach. The company is limping, bleeding, and mourning.What is our next move?**Return to Kochendorf:** Claim the remaining 5,570 crowns** and get the survivors to a healer and a tavern immediately.Camp and Console:** Let Maike** attempt to settle the spirits of the men (and perhaps explain what happened to Theudebald) before you show your faces in town.The "Fodder" Protocol:** Would you like me to adjust the formation to place Zombie Theudebald** in the most dangerous position for the next trek?

Just as the battle ends and things begin to quiet, I hear a man shouting. I move toward the noise to find a lone soldier, hiding in the ruins. He's not eaten for a fiew days, and barely has water with him. After he's given some minimal amount of food, he meekly asks if maybe he could join my outfit, not willing to go back home.  ---  Looks like he was trapped somehow. We took him in.  ---  More than happy with your reply, he enthusiastically falls within your rank, despite what he went through. You can see it though, a fire in his eyes. Hatred. You should keep your eye on him next time he sees a spirit ...  ---

## Gemini

A New Flame in the RuinAmidst the stench of ozone and rot, you find a survivor—a lone soldier who has been staring into the dark for days. His body is weak from hunger, but as he takes his place in the ranks of the Usurper's Bane**, it’s clear his spirit hasn't broken. If anything, it’s hardened into something dangerous.The way he looks at the spot where the Geists fell—and the way he glances at the shambling remains of Theudebald**—tells you everything. He isn't here for the crowns; he's here for a reckoning.The New Recruit: The SurvivorOrigin:** Trapped soldier found in the Remote Graveyard.Trait:** Vengeful/Hatred.** He has a burning grudge against the supernatural.Status:** Fed and hydrated, but mentally scarred.The irony isn't lost on the company: you lost a sister in Hiltrude** and a man's soul in Theudebald**, but the graveyard gave back a soldier fueled by the very horrors that took them.With the new recruit falling in line and the "fodder" formerly known as Theudebald leading the way, the long trek back to Kochendorf** begins. The weight of 5,570 crowns** waiting for you is the only thing keeping some of the men moving.How shall we enter the village?**Quietly and Medically:** Head straight to the healer to patch up Necola** and Sorrel** before their wounds fester.Triumphant (with a warning):** Go straight to Raginari** to show him the "proof" and the cost of his safe roads.Would you like me to give the new soldier a name and a place in your formation, or shall we wait until he survives his first "mathematical" lesson from Lady Amelia?**

He is an ARBALESTER named Thordis. After being rescued by the grasp of supernatural horrors, Thordis has sworn to return the favor in the only way a soldier would know - A sturdy, reliable and trained pair of hands, in your service. The hate for their past captors being a bonus you will not complain about.  We could use his skills.  ---  You return to Kochendorf and talk to Raginari of Kochendorf. The details of your journey are simple: you banished the ghosts, and purified the place. He nods, smiling tersely before handing over your payment as agreed upon.  " I knew one with your unique ... skillset could handle this, here, money well earned. "  ---  Money well earned indeed. I told the party to set camp outside of town. After the battle we are not in the best shape to move right now. We rest up and prepare for the next adventure. It is now the Night of Day 27

## Gemini

Respite for the Usurper's BaneThe heavy clink of 5,570 crowns**—the final installment of the staggering 6,960 crown total**—is a sweet sound, but it cannot drown out the groans of the wounded. Raginari** pays with a terse smile, clearly relieved to have the "vatt'ghern" and their grim company out of his hair and the curse lifted from his lands.Outside the village walls, the camp is somber. The campfire light flickers across Necola’s** pale face as she tends to her deep gashes, and catches the dull, mindless eyes of Zombie Theudebald**, standing motionless at the edge of the light. Thordis**, the new Arbalester, sits apart, meticulously cleaning his weapon. The "fire" in his eyes hasn't dimmed; he looks ready to bolt a bolt through the head of anything that doesn't cast a shadow.Night of Day 27: Camp ReportTreasury:** Massive surplus. You are now wealthy enough to outfit the company in the finest plate and mail Kochendorf can offer.The New Blood:** Thordis the Arbalester** is integrated. His hatred of the supernatural will make him a deadly asset alongside Maike and your Witcher.Condition:** * Necola & Sorrel:** Critically wounded; need time and medical supplies to reach full fighting strength.Theudebald:** Reanimated. Effective as fodder, but a grim sight for morale.Hiltrude:** Empty seat at the fire.The moon hangs high over the fertile lands of Kochendorf. For now, the "Usurper's Bane" rests. You have a Vala, a legendary Swordmaster, a vengeful Arbalester, and a purse overflowing with gold.What is your first order of business for Day 28?**The Grand Armory:** Spend our thousands of crowns in Kochendorf to buy heavy armor and legendary-tier weapons.Maike’s Runes:** Have the Vala begin inscripting our new gear with the sigils she promised.The Healer's Tent:** Prioritize the recovery of Necola and Sorrel before we even think about moving.Would you like me to suggest a shopping list for the market based on your new wealth?**

I spent the night studying the corpses and remains from the last two fights. I emerged from my tent close to midday the next day. My party was working on training and repairing their gear. I approached NeCola and showed her what my study has yield - a geist mutegen.

## Gemini

The Alchemist’s BreakthroughThe sun is high by the time you pull back the flap of your tent, eyes bloodshot from a night of grisly study. While the men sharpened steel and Maike** hummed low chants over the gear, you were elbow-deep in the ethereal residue and necrotic marrow of your fallen foes.The Geist Mutagen** glows with a faint, sickly luminescence in its vial, a swirling essence of the very thing that nearly tore the company apart.The Gift of the GeistYou find Necola** sitting on a whetstone, her bandages seeped with fresh red. She looks at the vial, then up at you, her silver eyes narrowing. She knows what this is—a chance to bridge the gap between human limitation and the supernatural speed of the ghosts you fought."You want me to drink that*?" she asks, a ghost of a smirk playing on her lips despite her wounds. "I already fight like a demon, Captain. You trying to make me look like one, too?"She takes the vial. If anyone’s constitution can handle the strain of a mutation, it’s the Silver Sword.Midday Status: Day 28The Mutation:** Necola has the Geist Mutagen. (Depending on your internal rules, this could grant her a massive boost to Initiative, the ability to pass through zones of control, or a terrifying presence that breaks enemy morale).Company Condition:** * Repairs:** Nearly complete. The smell of oil and whetstones fills the air.Thordis:** Watching the process with grim fascination. He’s never seen a Captain who experiments on his own lieutenants.Zombie Theudebald:** Still standing where you left him, a silent sentinel in the noon sun.The men are rested, and the purse is heavy.** With the Mutagen administered and the gear repaired, we are at a crossroads.What shall we do with our afternoon in Kochendorf?**The Marketplace:** We haven't spent that 5,500+ crown windfall yet. Shall we buy some Top-Tier Armor** for our front line?Lady Amelia's Drill:** Have the Swordmaster put Thordis** and the others through a rigorous training session to sharpen their "mathematics"?Seek a New Path:** Check the town one last time for any rumors of where the "Cataclysm" Maike spoke of might strike next?

## Gemini

Session 9 Wrap-Up: The Price of PowerWhat a session! You’ve transitioned from a band of mercenaries into a force dealing with the truly supernatural. The Usurper's Bane** is wealthier, deadlier, and stranger than ever before.🛡️ The Company’s EvolutionNew Recruits:** You added the mystical Maike (Vala)**, the legendary Lady Amelia (Swordmaster)**, and the vengeful Thordis (Arbalester)** to your ranks.The Mutation:** You spent the night in gruesome study to produce a Geist Mutagen**, granting Necola the Silver Sword** powers that blur the line between human and spirit.The "Fodder":** Theudebald remains with the company, though his soul is gone—he now serves as a mindless Wiederganger** shield for his former brothers.⚔️ Major EngagementsThe Brigand Skirmish:** A quick, efficient slaughter north of Ohnemenschen.The Kochendorf Infestation:** A massive purge of 20+ Nachzehrers and their kin, earning the town's trust and a solid 800 crowns.The Remote Graveyard:** A harrowing 11-round battle against Geists and Possessed Nobles. Though victorious, the cost was the life of Hiltrude** and the "death" of Theudebald**.💰 Logistics & EconomyMassive Windfall:** You successfully completed the contract for Raginari, leaving you with a staggering treasury surplus (nearly 7,000 crowns** earned this session alone).Location:** Camped outside Kochendorf** on the afternoon of Day 28**.Status:** Gear is repaired, wounds are binding, and the men are battle-hardened.The Usurper's Bane** has survived the aetherium, but the "cataclysm" Maike warned of still looms on the horizon.Next time we pick up, shall we spend that mountain of gold in the Kochendorf markets, or is it time to move out and see where the Vala’s path leads us?**
