The firs tthing i did was to pick up a recruit at ravens' town. I paid about 5000 crowns for this lad named WILFRIED. His BACKGROUND was labeled REBEL CHAT, with the following description:  ---  These fierce looking spirits clad in the armor of their previous lives are known as the mighty Ancestral Vatgern. Their drive to complete whatever mission their human coils set out to do whether that was a mutation, a Trial of the Grasses was so strong that death itself could not stop their ambition. In the after life they have made a compact with their god - the Azure Lord himself to live on in spectral form to complete what they have started.  ---  With 2 stars in melee defense, he should be a good addition to my frontline. Finally, someone not as much of a fodder as the rest

A heavy mist rolls into Ravens' Town as Wilfried** approaches the campfire. The air grows noticeably colder, and the flickering light plays off the spectral armor of a man who refused to let death end his contract. For 5,000 crowns, you haven't just hired a mercenary; you've secured a pact with an Ancestral Vatgern**.The rest of the men shift uncomfortably, feeling the supernatural weight of the Azure Lord’s champion. With those two stars in Melee Defense**, Wilfried isn't just a wall—he’s a ghost that refuses to be moved.New Entry: The Roster**Wilfried (Rebel Chat/Ancestral Vatgern):** A high-tier spectral recruit. His mission from his previous life continues under your banner.The townspeople of Ravens' Town give the Vatgern a wide berth, crossing themselves as you prepare to depart. With such a powerful (and expensive) asset now on the frontline, the "fodder" behind him might actually survive the day.Where shall we lead this spectral warrior first? Do we have a contract in hand, or are we heading into the wilds to test Wilfried's steel?**

Right outside of town is a pack of "Some Nachzehrers". Wonderful. We shall use them as training dummy.

The smell of carrion fills the air as the Nachzehrers lunged from the brush, but the fight was over before the ghouls could even feast. A swift, three-round slaughter.Necola** and Bardolf** led the charge, carving through the beasts with practiced efficiency. Wilfried**, the new spectral recruit, held the line as expected, taking no damage while testing his ghostly edge on the monsters. However, Arnulf** wasn't so lucky—he took a nasty mauling, losing 66 Health in the fray. He'll be limping to the next camp.Battle Report: The Aftermath**The MVP:** Bardolf**, dealing a staggering 110 damage and securing a kill.The Casualty:** Arnulf** is badly wounded. He needs time in the medical tent or a steady supply of bandages if he's to survive the next bout.The New Blood:** Wilfried** saw his first action; while he didn't get a killing blow, his presence on the frontline kept the formation stable.The ground is littered with black blood and shredded hides. The "training dummies" have been disposed of, but the cost was Arnulf's blood.Shall we set up camp to let Arnulf's wounds knit, or do you intend to push back into Ravens' Town to see if that victory earned you any favor (or better contracts)?**

Time to move on, don't forget we have a quest to Stohl. Along the way we picked up a refugee by the name of Dauid.  Catastrophes are cheap. Dauid hails  from a tiny vi//age that was  destroyed, to put it succinctly. But  Dauid is a survivor. Dauid fled the  disaster with only clothes. A horrific  history scars Dauid's body and  glazes their eyes, but the mercenary  is easily motivated to never  experience that past again.


---


## Gemini

The road to Stohl** is a weary one, and your company grows more eclectic by the league. Joining the ranks of spectral warriors and battle-hardened veterans is Dauid**, a man who has looked into the abyss of a destroyed home and chose to keep walking. He arrives with nothing but the rags on his back and a hollow look in his eyes—another mouth to feed, but a soul with absolutely nothing left to lose.With Arnulf** still clutching his side from the Nachzehrer encounter, the addition of a survivor like Dauid adds a grim layer to the party. He’s seen a catastrophe; he might find your mercenary life a step up from the ruins of his past.Updated Roster**Dauid (Refugee):** Low equipment, high motivation. A blank slate forged by tragedy.Current Destination:** Stohl.Condition:** Arnulf is still heavily wounded (66 HP lost).As you march toward Stohl, the horizon remains gray. The Abyssal Mage’s influence is a silent weight on the wind, and the "survivor" Dauid watches the treeline nervously, perhaps expecting the same disaster that took his village to emerge from the shadows.Do you want to check Dauid's stats and assign him some of the Nachzehrer loot, or shall we focus on reaching Stohl before Arnulf's wounds take a turn for the worse?**

Well Dauid will just be another fodder of the frontline. We made a hitch stop at Thal by the night of Day 11


---


## Gemini

The sun dips below the horizon, casting long, jagged shadows as you pull into Thal** on the night of Day 11**.The arrival is somber. Arnulf** is pale from blood loss, and Dauid**—the "survivor" turned "fodder"—clutches a borrowed spear with white knuckles, looking every bit the replacement for the men you expect to lose. In the flickering torchlight of the village, the spectral armor of Wilfried** hums with a faint, otherworldly glow, a stark contrast to the desperate refugees and weary peasants of the town.Status Check: Day 11 (Night)**The Roster:** Wilfried (Vatgern) stands firm; Dauid (Refugee) is integrated into the front line.Health:** Arnulf is in critical need of healing after that Nachzehrer mauling.Current Mood:** The men are tired, and the night air in Thal is thick with the scent of woodsmoke and old trauma.The local tavern offers a chance to patch up Arnulf and perhaps find a cheap shield for Dauid before the final leg to Stohl**.Shall we rest at the inn to accelerate Arnulf's recovery, or do you want to check the market for any gear to make Dauid slightly more "durable" fodder?**

We passed be hamererden in the night of Day 12. We didnt stop there seeing there arent much going on. by Day 13 mid-day, we reached Stohl. Once again, nothing much going on. It is time, we paid 360 coins to set sail to the southern city state of Ka-Sabar

## Gemini

The long march across the north comes to an end. After bypassing the quiet streets of Hamererden** under the cover of night, you reached Stohl** at noon on Day 13**. Finding the town stagnant and devoid of worthy contracts, you made the executive call to leave the cold behind.You hand over 360 crowns** to a ship captain, and the company boards a vessel bound for the shimmering sands. The transition is jarring; the biting winds of the north are replaced by the salt-heavy, sweltering heat of the south as the spires of Ka-Sabar** appear on the horizon.Arrival: Ka-Sabar (The Gilded Pearl)**The Date:** Day 13 (Afternoon)The Party:** You arrive with your full roster, including the wounded Arnulf**, the spectral Wilfried**, and the "fodder-to-be" Dauid**.The Environment:** The City-States are a different world. The laws are stricter, the sun is deadlier, and the enemies—from Nomads to Gilded slavers—are far more cunning than Nachzehrers.The Abyssal Mage's path has led you to the desert. Here, the "Azure Lord" that Wilfried serves may feel like a distant memory under the scorching sun of the Viziers.How do we begin our Southern campaign? Shall we visit the Alchemist for medicines to finally seal Arnulf's wounds, or head straight to the Vizier's court to see what high-paying contracts the City-State offers?**

We reached Ka Sabar. "Dammit" was the first thing I said. There was no event, no quests that I am strong enough to take on. Economy is bad - nothing to trade. Let's move on to the next city by the name of Ras Karim. On the way there, there was a lone hyena. Pretty annoyed, I created myself an entertainment. "You fodders, go dance around that hyena and see how many bites you can dodge" I commanded. Unfortunate for them, "not many bites" was the answer.  # VICTORY  The enemy was destroyed in 5 rounds  | Statistics | Loot |  |---|---|  | | |  | Character | Kills | Damage Dealt | XP Gained | Health Lost |  |---|---|---|---|---|  | HIYUN | 0 | 0 | XP 81 | 0 |  | NECOLA THE VATT'GHERN | 1 | 75 | XP 100 | 0 |  | KAETHERLEN | 0 | 56 | XP 48 | 0 |  | WILFRIED B | 0 | 34 | XP 66 | 0 |  | BARDOL F | 0 | 0 | XP 0 | 123 |  | DAUID | 1 | 0 | XP 28 | 71 |  | JAN F THE BRIGHT | 1 | 0 | XP 64 | 91 |  | ARNULF F | 0 | 0 | XP 0 | 92 |  | EVETT E THE RABBIT | 0 | 0 | XP 0 | 67 |  ---  Arnulf and Evett have both met their final death. BARDOL DAUID and JAN continue to be perma injury collectors

## Gemini

The desert is a cruel mistress, and your "entertainment" on the road to Ras Karim** has proven bloodier than any contract. You commanded a dance with a lone hyena, and the beast turned the sands red.Arnulf** and Evett the Rabbit**—men who survived the northern wastes and the claws of Nachzehrers—now lie dead in the dunes, their throats torn open by a single scavenger. The "fodder" has been thinned, and the survivors are more scar tissue than men.Casualty Report: The Hyena's Feast**KIA:** Arnulf F** and Evett E the Rabbit**. Their journey ends here, forgotten in the sands.The Walking Wounded:** * Bardolf:** Sustained a massive 123 damage. He lives, but he is broken.Jan the Bright:** 91 damage taken.Dauid:** The refugee survived his first real test with 71 damage and a kill, though he’s now a "permanent injury collector."The Elites:** Necola** and Wilfried** remain untouched, watching the carnage with cold indifference.Current State: Road to Ras Karim**The air is thick with the smell of musk and copper. You have three men clinging to life with permanent deformities, two fresh graves, and a company that is rapidly becoming a collection of the maimed led by a ghost and a Vatt'ghern.The "Abyssal Mage" might find this grim comedy amusing, but your frontline is shattered. Ras Karim** looms ahead.Do we limp into Ras Karim to find replacements for the dead, or do you intend to push these "injury collectors" even further to see who else the desert claims?**

Thats a wrap for session 4. Please put together a session summary

## Gemini

Session 4 Summary: The Desert’s Bloody Toll**The company’s transition from the frozen north to the scorching southern deserts was marked by high costs, spectral reinforcements, and a grim display of Darwinism.1. The Spectral Acquisition**The session began in Ravens' Town**, where you spent 5,000 crowns** to secure a pact with Wilfried**, an Ancestral Vatgern (Rebel Chat)**. A ghostly warrior bound by the Azure Lord, Wilfried brought much-needed stability and elite defensive stars to a frontline previously dominated by "fodder."2. The Long March South**The Training Run:** A pack of Nachzehrers outside Ravens' Town served as a live-fire exercise. While the beasts were routed in 3 rounds, Arnulf** took a severe mauling, signaling the beginning of a dark trend for the rank-and-file.The New Blood:** Along the road to Stohl**, you picked up Dauid**, a trauma-scarred Refugee**. He was immediately designated as frontline fodder, a role he would soon fulfill with bloody results.The Voyage:** Finding the northern economy stagnant and quests lacking, you paid 360 crowns** to sail from Stohl to the City-State of Ka-Sabar**, seeking better fortunes in the heat.3. The Hyena’s "Dance"**Disappointed by the poor economy in Ka-Sabar, the company set out for Ras Karim**. To stave off boredom, you commanded your men to "dance" with a lone hyena. The "entertainment" turned into a massacre for the weaker brothers:The Fallen:** Arnulf F** and Evett E the Rabbit** met their final deaths, their luck finally running dry in the sand.The Maimed:** Bardolf**, Jan the Bright**, and the newcomer Dauid** all survived but sustained massive damage and a collection of permanent injuries**.Current Company Status**Elite Core:** Necola the Vatt'ghern** and Wilfried** remain pristine and untouched, the only pillars of strength in a crumbling line.The Wounded:** The frontline is now a "collection of injury collectors," barely clinging to life as you approach Ras Karim**.Financials:** Significant investment in Wilfried and travel leaves the company needing a high-paying contract to justify the recent losses.The desert has already begun to prune the weak from your ranks. Would you like me to archive these casualties and prepare the roster for the start of Session 5 in Ras Karim?**
