# Session 8 Log

## User

Session 8 let's go! Having finally gathered the coin and equipment, you manage to assemble a full complement of twelve able fighters. When next you walk down Gipfelfeste's main street, the men break into a full-throated marching song. A few of the townsfolk mutter under their breath about dirty mercenaries taking over the town, but others walk alongside and shout the words with you.  "Stand tall, brothers. People can see this is a real mercenary company now, and not a handful of wandering vagabonds."  HiYun declares.  "We trade in strength, and now that our numbers have gone up, so will our price." "We trade in strength, and now that our numbers have gone up, so will our price."  It appears he has the right of it. You notice one particularly fat nobleman sizing up the company as if he already has a task in mind. The Usurper's Bane are now a force to be reckoned with. Once the men have settled in for a celebratory drink, perhaps you should take another stroll through town to see if any more lucrative contracts may be available.

The air in Gipfelfeste feels different today. The rhythmic thud of twenty-four boots on the cobblestones carries a weight that a ragtag group of five never could. The Usurper's Bane** is no longer a rumor; it is a presence.As the men head for the tavern to wash the road dust from their throats, the "full-throated" echoes of their song still bounce off the timber-framed houses. HiYun** wipes a bit of grit from his brow, his eyes following that fat nobleman who was eyeing your line."The coin we spent on those recruits was an investment," HiYun mutters, leaning against a post near the town square. "But steel and grain aren't cheap with twelve mouths to feed. Let's see if that noble's purse is as heavy as he looks."Current Status**Company:** The Usurper's BaneRoster:** 12/12 Men (Full Complement)Location:** Gipfelfeste (Main Street/Market)Mood:** Celebratory/ConfidentThe town is yours to navigate. That nobleman is still lingering near the high hall, but the town's contract board might have smaller tasks if you'd rather blood the new recruits on something less "political."How would you like to proceed?** Shall we approach the nobleman directly, check the town's mercenary contracts, or perhaps visit the market to ensure these new men are actually armed with more than just high spirits?

In celebration, I decided to bestow the raven's blessing on Godfrey our new member --- RAVEN'S CURSE A dark binding set by the Winged Architect. The Raven's Mark grants the bearer dark powers, but at a cost: their very body is cursed, sapping their strength. Old legends whisper of men who sought to grow stronger than the mark itself by drawing closer to the Raven through the purification of their blood. ---

---

## Gemini

The celebration in the tavern takes a sudden, somber turn as you call Godfrey** forward. The laughter of the men dies down into a heavy silence as you prepare to bestow the Raven's Curse**.As the ritual concludes, a dark energy settles over the recruit. Godfrey gasps, his skin paling as the Mark takes hold. He looks down at his hands, feeling the surge of Abyssal power thrumming in his veins, even as the "dark binding" begins to tax his physical frame. The cost is immediate—he feels the sap of his natural strength, but the potential for the Winged Architect's power now sleeps within him.HiYun** watches from the shadows of the booth, his expression unreadable. "A heavy gift for a new man," he whispers. "Let’s hope Godfrey has the constitution to outgrow the mark before it consumes him."The Ritual Results**The Recipient:** Godfrey (New Member)The Boon:** Access to dark powers and the Raven's Mark.The Toll:** Body cursed, strength sapped (Physical attributes decreased).The Path:** He must now seek the "purification of blood" to master the curse.The rest of the company looks at Godfrey with a mix of awe and trepidation. With the blessing—or curse—now manifested, the Usurper's Bane feels more like an extension of your Abyssal will than ever before.Would you like to head out to find a contract to test Godfrey's new powers, or shall we visit the market to see if any items might help mitigate his sudden physical weakness?\*\*

We then continue our journey west-wards, towards EISENSTEIN - A stretched out settlement nestled into the surrounding mountains. The hammering of pickaxes against stone can be heard from a distance.

---

## Gemini

The march west is grueling, but the Usurper's Bane** moves with a new, disciplined rhythm. As the peaks of the mountains begin to crowd the sky, the rhythmic, metallic clink-clink-clink\* of industry drifts on the wind.Eisenstein** unfolds before you—a town literally carved into the slopes. It’s a place of soot, grit, and hard labor. The atmosphere here is a stark contrast to the celebratory air of Gipfelfeste; here, the folk are as hard as the stone they mine.As you enter the settlement, the miners pause their hammering to eye your twelve-man line. They see the armor, the steel, and perhaps they sense the lingering darkness surrounding Godfrey**.HiYun** adjusts his gear, looking at the smoke rising from the local smithies. "A mining town always has problems," he grunts. "Usually things with too many legs in the deep tunnels, or bandits eyeing the ore shipments. Either way, they'll have crowns for us."Arrival: Eisenstein**Atmosphere:** Industrial, cramped, and echoes with the sound of pickaxes.Opportunities:** The smithy here likely produces quality tools and armor, and the local leaders are surely looking for protection for their caravans.The company is tired from the mountain trek and hungry. Would you like to head straight to the local tavern to see what contracts are pinned to the board, or shall we seek out a merchant to see if Eisenstein’s famous ores are available for trade?**

We went looking for jobs, and found this: --- You find Hallstein of Eisenstein talking to a druidic monk cloaked in shapes more familiar to beasts than man. Horns for a helmet, bearskin for armor, and the hooves of deer clattering around his chest in a brutish necklace. He's quite the sight. Seeing you, Hallstein of Eisenstein waves you in.  "Sellsword! It is good to see you -- "  The druid pushes the man out of the way mid-talk. He speaks with a wobble in his voice, as though he were speaking from the depths of a cavern.  "A mercenary, ha! Surely you are a man of faith, no? We of Eisenstein have lost the Staff of Foresight. This relic is of great import to us, for through it we can speak to the old gods and have our prayers answered. It's been stolen away, in some manner or another, to the Ruins of Blackwatch Keep. Go there and retrieve it." You glance at Hallstein of Eisenstein who nods.  "Aye, what he said." "Rest assured that what I'm offering you now is a fine prize for your work. It's 790 crowns when the contract is done." --- We accepted the quest to Obtain Staff of Foresight at Ruins of Blackwatch Keep

---

## Gemini

The druid watches you with eyes that seem to reflect the dark canopy of a forest, his hoof-necklace clattering as he bows slightly. Hallstein** looks relieved to have the matter out of his hands, though he seems a bit overwhelmed by his companion's intensity."Blackwatch Keep," HiYun** spits on the ground, his hand resting on his sword hilt. "The name alone sounds like a place where the sun forgot to shine. If it’s 'Old Gods' business, we’d best keep our wits about us. 790 crowns is a fair shake, but it won't buy back a soul if the ruins decide to keep ours."The company prepares for the trek. The men are murmuring about the druid’s appearance, but the prospect of nearly 800 crowns keeps their boots moving. Godfrey**, bearing the Raven's Mark, seems particularly attuned to the "wobble" in the druid's voice—a resonance that feels all too familiar.Mission Briefing**Objective:** Retrieve the Staff of Foresight**.Destination:** Ruins of Blackwatch Keep.Reward:** 790 Crowns upon completion.Employer:** Hallstein and the Druidic Monk.The journey to the ruins will take you further into the shadows of the mountains. Before you leave the gates of Eisenstein, do you wish to buy any specific supplies** (like medicinal supplies or extra tools) for the delve, or shall we set off immediately\*\* for Blackwatch Keep?

We found the location somewhere north of GIPFELFESTE. --- You send a few of the men into the ruins to find the Staff of Foresight. All of them return in a hurry, which is unusual as they have a strong inclination to dawdle about to eat up sunlight and earn an easy day's salary. Thankfully, one of them has the relic in hand. Unfortunately, they all look like they've seen a ghost. They need not explain the source of their horror as a group of skittering, armor-clanking undead emerge from the ruins and level their spears at your company. --- We are in big trouble, there are two champion mummy among the line of bone warriors. The fight was tough but we made it out alive... well most of us did, except KAETHERLEN who's skeleton skull was smashed into powder form VICTORY The enemy was destroyed in 7 rounds Statistics Loot | Character | Kills | Damage Dealt | XP Gained | Damage Taken | |---|---|---|---|---| | HIYUN | 1 | 0 | XP 174 | 0 | | NECOLA THE VATT'GHERN | 1 | 302 | XP 124 | 0 | | WILFRIED B | 2 | 99 | XP 342 | 124 | | DAUID F | 0 | 0 | XP 74 | 0 | | ABANOUB E IBN MANSUR | 0 | 0 | XP 99 | 0 | | IMAMADDIN E REACH FLAIL | 0 | 7 | XP 99 | 0 | | HARUN D AL-BAJI | 0 | 110 | XP 77 | 21 | | FRETHWI A | 0 | 63 | XP 99 | 35 | | FRESSENDA | 0 | 73 | XP 99 | 0 | | GODFREY | 1 | 65 | XP 128 | 44 | | SORREL F | 1 | 88 | XP 124 | 104 | | KAETHERLEN F | 0 | 0 | XP 63 | 241 |

## Gemini

The heavy silence that follows the battle is broken only by the sound of boots shifting over ancient dust and the rattling of the Staff of Foresight**. You’ve secured the relic, but the cost is etched into the dirt of Blackwatch Keep.Kaetherlen** is gone. The skeletal warrior who fought alongside you met a final, ironic end—his own skull shattered into a fine white powder by the very undead he once resembled. There is nothing left to bury, only a hollow space in the ranks where a silent sentinel once stood.Sorrel** and Wilfried** are leaning heavily on their weapons, their armor battered and slick with the ichor of the mummies. Godfrey**, testing his new Raven’s powers for the first time in true blood, managed to secure a kill, though the strain of the curse is visible in his labored breathing.HiYun** looks over the pulverized remains of Kaetherlen, then at the trembling men. "Seven rounds of hell," he rasps, sheathing his blade. "Those champions weren't looking to give that staff up. We’ve got the prize, but we’re a man down and bleeding. Let's get clear of these ruins before whatever else lives here realizes the 'guests' are wounded."Battle Aftermath**Casualties:** Kaetherlen** (Deceased - Smashed to powder).Injuries:** Wilfried** (Heavy damage), Sorrel** (Heavy damage), Frethwi**, and Godfrey** (Minor wounds).Loot:** Staff of Foresight** secured.MVP:** Necola the Vatt'ghern** dealt a staggering 302 damage, holding the line against the champions.The journey back to Eisenstein** to claim your 790 crowns feels longer with an empty spot in the formation.Would you like to head straight back to the Druid to collect your reward, or should we set up a temporary camp nearby to tend to Wilfried and Sorrel’s wounds before the long trek?**

## User

We headed back to town to close off the day... We reached by Day 24 night. --- You're not entirely sure what it was you ran into. Frethwi A asks if you know what they said.  "Seems like they were pointing you out specifically, sir."  Nodding, you tell the man you're not sure what the armored man said, but it matters not. You have the Staff of Foresight and it's time to return to Hallstein of Eisenstein for your pay. You find Hallstein of Eisenstein sitting in the town square, his arms up to the skies, his eyes closed, his mouth murmuring prayers. The townsfolk are all around him, kneeling and doing the same. You pick up a rock and hurl at a weathervane, the clank and rustic spins drawing everyone's attention.  You hold the relic up so all can see. Hallstein of Eisenstein jumps to his feet and takes the Staff of Foresight. The people roar with delight, speaking of good things to come. Your payment is handed to you which, truly, is what you would consider a 'good thing'. ---

---

## Gemini

The heavy purse of 790 crowns clinks satisfyingly against your belt, a sharp contrast to the hollow rattle that was Kaetherlen’s** final moments. As the miners and zealots of Eisenstein celebrate their recovered link to the Old Gods, the Usurper's Bane** stands apart in the torchlight—weary, bloodied, and one soul fewer.HiYun** watches the townsfolk dance around that staff with a cynical eye. "They pray to wood and bone," he mutters, "while we bleed to keep their superstitions alive. At least the gold is real." He gestures to the empty space in the formation. "We need to replace the skeleton. A company of twelve is only as strong as its weakest link, and right now, we have a gap."The night of Day 24** settles over the mountain settlement. The hammering of pickaxes has finally ceased, replaced by the rowdy cheers of the religious faithful.Day 24 Summary**Mission Status:** SUCCESSFUL**. Staff of Foresight returned.Payment Received:** +790 Crowns.Company Status:** 11/12 Men (Awaiting a replacement for Kaetherlen).Current Location:** Eisenstein (Night).The men are exhausted and Wilfried** and Sorrel** desperately need a night in a real bed to mend their wounds.Would you like me to oversee the recruitment of a new brother to fill Kaetherlen's spot, or should we spend the night at the tavern to let the men heal up before looking for our next contract in the morning?\*\*

We camped to let the crew rest. I spend the night studying the skeletal remains we collected from the mummies. Annoyingly, I lost track of time. By the time i left my tent, its Day 25 midday. We returned to the town looking for paid work. --- You are greeted by Hallstein of Eisenstein, who cuts to the chase.  "A few days ago, some children claimed they heard strange sounds while they were playing near the edge of town. I had my guards investigate, and they came back saying they found monstrous tracks in the vicinity."  You turn to look at the guards. One of them is lazily leaning into a makeshift polearm in a manner that makes you fear for the safety of their right eye. Another is staring in awe at Harun D Al-Baji, dreamily confessing their desire to become a hero like her someday. You refocus your attention on Hallstein of Eisenstein.  "Frankly, I wouldn't trust even my dog's life to any of my guards. I want you to head out and kill these beasts before they cause any trouble for us, you hear?" "Rest assured that what I'm offering you now is a fine prize for your work. It's 200 crowns in advance, and another 780 when the job is done." --- Beast hunting is what we are doing next it seems

---

## Gemini

The transition from the ancient, dusty silence of the mummies' remains to the bright midday sun of Day 25** is jarring. Your eyes are likely still stinging from the candlelight of your late-night study, but the clink of 200 crowns** in advance acts as a fine restorative.HiYun** eyes the lazy guards with a mix of pity and disgust. "If those are the men defending the walls, it’s a miracle the children only heard 'sounds' and weren't served as supper," he grunts, checking the tension on his shield strap. He looks at Harun D Al-Baji**, who seems a bit awkward under the hero-worship of the daydreaming guard, then back to you. "Monstrous tracks could mean anything from Nachzehrers to Unholds in these mountains. We need to be careful—beasts don't break like men or bones."The Usurper's Bane** is back up to strength (or close to it), and the thrill of a hunt is starting to stir the men. After the stiff, armored undead, a foe with flesh and blood might be just what the new recruits need to find their footing—provided they don't get eaten first.Contract Accepted: The Beast Hunt**Employer:** Hallstein of EisensteinTerms:** 200 Crowns (Paid) / 780 Crowns (On completion)Target:** Unknown "Monstrous" tracks near the edge of town.Intel:** The guards are useless; the tracks are fresh enough to cause concern.With the advance in your pocket, the company is ready to move.Shall we head to the outskirts to pick up the trail and see what kind of "beasts" we're dealing with, or do you want to use some of that advance to buy specific trophies or nets from the market to help with the hunt?\*\*

## User

We are up agains a pack of Webknechts, 14 of them in total. In addition to that is a champion ancient soldier. Since when do beast and undead work together?

---

## Gemini

The woods outside Eisenstein are thick with more than just mountain mist. As the first chittering sounds reach your ears, the sight before you defies the natural order. Fourteen Webknechts**—bloated, multi-eyed horrors—skitter through the trees, their silk glistening in the midday sun.But standing amongst the hairy legs and clicking mandibles is a sight that chills the blood: a Champion Ancient Soldier**. Its bronze armor is tarnished, and its movements are mechanical and relentless. It doesn't scream or hunger like the spiders; it simply exists to slay.HiYun** draws his blade, his knuckles white. "Since when do the dead and the skittering share a table?" he hisses. "Spiders want our meat, and that... thing\*... just wants our lives. They aren't working together, Captain—we've just walked into a nightmare where the spiders are the hunters and that Champion is the wall we have to break through to escape."Tactical Briefing: The Unholy Alliance**The Horde:** 14 Webknechts. (High risk of being overwhelmed/poisoned).The Threat:** 1 Champion Ancient Soldier. (Heavy armor, high skill, likely guarding a flank).The Field:** Watch for webs! If a brother gets pinned, the spiders will swarm before you can reach the Champion.Godfrey** feels the Raven’s Mark pulse. The presence of the Ancient Soldier feels like a cold echo of the mummies from Blackwatch Keep.The spiders are closing in fast.** Do you want to form a tight shield wall** to weather the initial charge and the webs, or will you order your heavy hitters (like Necola and Wilfried) to target the Champion immediately\*\* to keep it from pinning your line down while the others deal with the pests?

---

## User

None other than NeCola could deal with the champion. Even with her skills, we had to surround the skeletal warrior to gain every bit of adventage. We merge victorious. DAUID our fodder did its job in forming the meat shield and has successfully "graduated" (died permanently). --- VICTORY The enemy was destroyed in 11 rounds Statistics Loot | Character | Kills | Damage Dealt | XP Gained | Health Lost | |---|---|---|---|---| | HIYUN | 0 | 3 | 340 | 92 | | NECOLA THE VATT'GHERN | 3 | 550 | 838 | 0 | | WILFRIED B | 0 | 0 | 340 | 270 | | ABANOUB E IBN MANSUR | 0 | 0 | 269 | 0 | | IMAMADDIN E REACH FLAIL | 2 | 90 | 303 | 0 | | HARUN D AL-BAJI | 0 | 77 | 215 | 0 | | FRETHWI A | 1 | 62 | 286 | 0 | | FRESSENDA | 0 | 156 | 269 | 0 | | GODFREY | 2 | 147 | 303 | 0 | | SORREL F | 0 | 40 | 269 | 22 | | DAUID F | 2 | 90 | 67 | 378 | ---

## Gemini

Eleven grueling rounds in the thick of the webs and the cold bronze of the past. The forest floor is littered with severed arachnid legs and the shattered remnants of the Champion's ancient plate.NeCola** was a whirlwind of steel, accounting for a massive 550 damage** and personally dismantling the Champion and two others. But the real story is Dauid**. He took a staggering 378 damage**, his armor shredded and his blood soaking the mountain soil as he held the line until the very end. He "graduated" in the most absolute way possible—he died permanently, a literal wall of meat and iron that finally collapsed.HiYun** wipes green spider ichor from his shield, looking over at Dauid's broken body. "He did his job," he says grimly, nodding toward the 'fodder' who held the line. "But he won't be joining us for the next fight. He's earned his rest."Even Godfrey** found his rhythm, claiming two kills as the Raven's Mark hummed with the energy of the slaughter.Battle Aftermath: The Beast Hunt**The Hero:** NeCola** (3 Kills, 550 Damage). The Champion stood no chance once she engaged.The Fallen:** Dauid** (378 Health lost). He stood at the threshold of death and was dragged across.The Tally:** 11 Rounds. The spiders are cleared, the Champion is dust.Casualties:** Dauid** (Permanent Death).You return to Eisenstein with the news. The 780 crowns are as good as yours, and the town children can play safely once more.Shall we head to the tavern to settle the bill and pour one out for Dauid and his "graduation," or do you want to check the market for some high-quality armor to replace what was destroyed in the struggle?\*\*

We returned to the employer by the same day before sunset. ---Hallstein of Eisenstein is hosting a birthday party when you enter his room with a giant dead spider and fling the corpse across the floor. Its bristly hairs hiss as they scratch across the stone and its eight legs scuttle upside down like some furniture of horror and it strays sideways and pops off the corner of a bookshelf and flips onto its toes and prongs there as though ready to pounce. Chaos breaks out as everyone screams and runs out the door or bails from the nearest open window, a litter of colorful confetti playfully twirling in their wake. The townsman stands alone amongst the emptied space and purses his lips. "Truly, sellsword, was that necessary?" You nod and tell him that hiring you was necessary and that paying you will still be very necessary. The man shakes his head and gestures with a fake donkey tail to the corner of the room. "Your satchel's over there with 780 crowns, as agreed upon. Now get that awful thing out of here and tell those fine folks the reveries need not be over." --- With this I believe that's everything this town has to offer.

---

## Gemini

The image of that giant Webknecht skittering across the polished floor like a "furniture of horror" is one for the chronicles. Hallstein** standing there with a fake donkey tail pinned to his backside, staring at the carnage of his ruined party, is perhaps the most satisfying way to end a contract.HiYun** can't help but smirk as he hauls the satchel of 780 crowns over his shoulder. "Necessary? No. Effective? Absolutely," he chuckles, watching the last of the party guests scramble through a window. "They wanted proof of monsters; we gave them a centerpiece."With the advance and the final payment, the Usurper's Bane** is flush with gold, and while Dauid’s seat at the tavern is now empty, his sacrifice ensured the rest of the company reached the town in peace.Session 8 so far...**The Purse:** +780 Crowns (Totaling 980 for the job).The Reputation:** You are now known in Eisenstein as "the mercenary who ruins birthdays" (and saves lives).The Roster:** 11/12 Men. Dauid** is fallen, NeCola** is a legend, and Godfrey** is becoming something... else.The Legacy:** Kaetherlen** is remembered in the dust of Blackwatch Keep.The sun is dipping below the mountain peaks, casting long, jagged shadows over Eisenstein. You’ve cleared the ruins, retrieved the staff, and purged the "beasts" from the outskirts. There truly is nothing left here but the smell of soot and the echoes of screaming party-goers.Shall we move out under the cover of night to avoid Hallstein’s awkward glares, and if so, which direction on the world map shall we strike out toward next?\*\*

I decided to visit FUHRTMARK before moving further north. Entering town, we saw this --- You approach the square to see what the commotion is about. A well-dressed, armored figure stands at the center, voice steady, though their eyes betray a flicker of unease. A crowd has gathered, all drawn by whispers carried on the wind, whispers of a new horror. With a booming voice, he shouts:  "A threat has been sighted. A foul new breed of abomination now roams the land! Things made of grafted flesh, sewn limb to limb, moaning and screaming with every twisted step. They carry with them the stink of rot, and worse ... they do not walk alone! Deranged minds lead them, men who speak to bones and wear madness like a crown. If you value your life, steer well clear."  Gasps ripple through the crowd. Mothers clutch their children. Old men shake their heads, muttering prayers. But you ... you are left with a different impression ... --- I know exactly what he was going on about. in fact, we have already faced such monster - fresh golem.

---

## Gemini

The crowd in Fuhrtmark** ripples with a primal fear, their faces pale under the flickering torchlight of the square. The armored figure’s description of "grafted flesh" and "sewn limbs" has the commoners terrified, but for the Usurper’s Bane**, this isn't a campfire ghost story—it's a combat log.HiYun** shifts his weight, his hand instinctively moving to the notch in his shield where a Flesh Golem’s blow once landed. He leans toward you, voice low so the panicked townsfolk don't overhear."They speak of them like they're new gods of terror," he grunts, eyes fixed on the shouting noble. "If only they knew we’ve already tasted that rot and come out the other side. These 'deranged minds' leading them... that’s the real threat. A golem is just a tool; the necromancer behind it is the hand that needs cutting."Godfrey** stands unusually still. To a man carrying the Raven's Mark**, the mention of "men who speak to bones" resonates with a dark, familiar frequency. The Abyssal power within him seems to stir at the mention of these twisted creations.Fuhrtmark Intelligence**The Rumor:** Flesh Golems (Flesh Stitchees) and Necromancers/Stitchers are active in the region.The Crowd:** Terrified and ripe for a "protector" to step forward.Your Edge:** You have first-hand experience with these abominations. You know they bleed, and you know they can be unmade.The armored figure finishes his warning, looking around for anyone brave—or foolish—enough to take up the challenge. The air in Fuhrtmark is thick with opportunity and the faint, metallic scent of a coming storm.How shall we handle this?** Do you want to step forward and announce your experience** to command a higher price for hunting these stitchers, or shall we quietly check the local tavern** to see if there's a specific bounty on the "deranged minds" leading these abominations?

Our frontline is thinning. It is time to replenish. For 200 crowns, I secure the service of Theudebald, a VAGABOND. Not quite one for the city, and not quite one for the wild, Theudebald F spends his purposeless days traveling between both. Strangely, one day he came across his long- forgotten brother he-never-had who said there was plenty of walking to be done for a mercenary outfit - and they'd pay him to do it, too! He's not particularly good at anything, but Theudebald F has seen and done a lot, and that's worth at least something.

---

## Gemini

The ranks of the Usurper's Bane** are whole once more. For a handful of crowns, Theudebald** steps into the space left by the powdered remains of Kaetherlen. He has the hollow look of a man who has walked a thousand miles to nowhere, but there’s a certain resilience in a vagabond—someone used to sleeping on stones and eating air.HiYun** looks the newcomer up and down, noting the travel-worn boots and the aimless stare. "A brother-he-never-had, eh?" HiYun chuckles, clapping a hand on the man’s shoulder hard enough to make him rattle. "Well, he's got twelve brothers now. Let's hope his 'purposeless days' have given him a thick enough skin to survive what the armored man was shouting about."Theudebald seems content just to have a direction to march in, even if that direction leads straight toward the "grafted flesh" and "deranged minds" haunting the north.Company Update**New Recruit:** Theudebald** (Vagabond).Role:** Generalist/Infantry (Fills the 12th slot).Cost:** 200 Crowns.Current Roster:** 12/12 (Full Strength).With the company replenished and the sun setting on Fuhrtmark, the whispers of the stitched abominations beckon. You have the men, you have the gold from Eisenstein, and you have a new "brother" to blood.Where to next, Captain?** Shall we head further north** to track these Flesh Golems and their masters, or do you want to put Theudebald through a quick drill** in the town square to see if he actually knows which end of a spear to hold?

## User

We headed north. By Day 26 midday, we reached OHNEMENSCHEN A small farming village living mostly off of the surrounding fertile lands.

---

## Gemini

The smell of manure and freshly turned earth replaces the mountain grit of Eisenstein as you arrive in Ohnemenschen**. It’s a quiet place, or at least it tries to be. The peasants here look at your twelve-man company with a mixture of hope and terror—hope that you’re here to protect their harvests, and terror that you’ll eat them out of house and home.Theudebald** looks around the fields with a nostalgic squint. "Fertile land," he mutters, "good for burying things. Or growing them, I suppose." He’s still finding his stride in the marching line, but his presence completes the dozen.HiYun** scans the perimeter of the village. Farming communities like this are soft targets for the "foul new breed" the man in Fuhrtmark warned about. To a necromancer, a village is just a warehouse of raw materials.Arrival: Ohnemenschen**Status:** Day 26, Midday.Environment:** Rural, exposed, fertile.Objective:** Find work, replenish food, and keep an eye out for "grafted" threats.The village headman is already approaching, nervously wringing a cap in his hands. He looks like a man with a problem and a very small purse to fix it with.How would you like to spend the afternoon?** Shall we talk to the headman** to see if the stitchers have been sighted near the fields, check the marketplace** for cheap grain to feed the twelve, or find a spot to train Theudebald\*\* before the sun goes down?

---

## User

We replenished our food supply. Much of it was sold off in the last town to make a profit. Aside from that, there werent much happening in this village. That is until this woman approached us and offered to join our ranks for just 50 crowns. Her name is Hiltrude, her BACKGROUND: WIDOW Married to a very intelligent man until a brigand knocked him over the head, Hiltrude was forced onto the streets, depending on the goodwill of others. Years have passed and took a toll on her health by now. "How sad," I mumbled, "perfect fit for the role of a fodder."

---

## Gemini

The transaction is cold and efficient. For 50 crowns—less than the price of a decent shield—Hiltrude** joins the ranks of the Usurper's Bane. She stands there in her tattered weeds, eyes hollow and skin sallow from years of "goodwill" and "toll," a stark contrast to the hardened killers around her.HiYun** doesn't even look her in the eye as he hands her a rusted spear. He just sighs and looks at you. "A widow and a vagabond. We're certainly building a company of the forgotten, Captain. Let’s hope she remembers how to stand still when the screaming starts. It’s a mercy, in a way—better to die with a weapon in hand than starving in a gutter."Theudebald** nods a silent greeting to his fellow "purposeless" traveler. The company is now a strange mix of Vatt'ghern skill, Abyssal curses, and desperate souls destined for the front line.Company Update**New Recruit:** Hiltrude** (Widow).Role:** Fodder / Meat Shield.Cost:** 50 Crowns.Condition:** Frail health, but desperate.Roster Status:** 13 Men (Including any followers/reserve).With the grain sacks full and your newest "investment" standing shivering in the line, Ohnemenschen has given you all it can. The midday sun is beginning to tilt toward evening on Day 26**.Where shall we lead this flock of veterans and victims next?** Do we continue the trek further North** into the heart of the "stitcher" rumors, or is there a nearby landmark** on the map you'd like to investigate while Hiltrude still has the strength to walk?

As we prepare to leave the village and continue the journey north, this happened: --- With a cocky grin, The Butcher strolls into your tent like he owns the place.  "I need a favor. Ohnemenschen's got something of mine, but I'm not welcome here. Could you, uh, go shopping for me?" He smiles.  "This will make you rich, my friend. You'll be paid 1500 crowns when the contract is done." --- Sounds like a trap. We didn't accept it.

A wise instinct. 1,500 crowns** for a "shopping trip" in a tiny farming village doesn't just smell like a trap—it reeks of a death sentence. No butcher pays that kind of gold for sausages and spices unless the "goods" are illegal, immoral, or currently guarded by the local militia's heads on pikes.HiYun** watches the man swagger out of the tent after your refusal, his hand never leaving his sword pommel. "A man who smiles that wide while offering that much gold is looking for a scapegoat, not a partner," he spits. "Let him find some other fools to hang for his 'favors.' We have real monsters to hunt."The men outside are already breaking camp. Hiltrude** looks relieved to be leaving the village behind—perhaps she feared the "favors" the Butcher had in mind involved people of her station. Theudebald** just adjusts his pack, ready for more walking.Current Status: Northward Bound**Decision:** Declined "The Butcher's" suspicious contract.Morale:** Stable. The men trust your judgment over easy, dirty coin.Inventory:** Food supplies replenished.Time:** Day 26, heading into the afternoon.The road north stretches out before you, away from the deceptive "smiles" of Ohnemenschen and toward the grim reality of the stitchers. The path ahead grows colder as the elevation rises.Shall we push hard through the evening to put distance between us and the Butcher, or would you like to scout the nearby woods for any of those "grafted" tracks before nightfall?**

## Gemini

What a session! The Usurper's Bane** has transformed from a wandering band into a formidable—if slightly eccentric—company of twelve (plus one). You've survived ancient horrors and mountain politics alike.Session 8 Chronology: The Raven and the Stitchers**1. The Ascension of the Bane:**You assembled a full 12-man roster in Gipfelfeste**, solidifying your status as a "real" mercenary company.The Ritual:** You bestowed the Raven’s Mark** on Godfrey**. He gained dark Abyssal powers at the cost of his physical vitality, beginning his journey toward "blood purification."2. The Delve into Blackwatch Keep:**Accepted a contract from a beast-clad Druid and Hallstein in Eisenstein** to retrieve the Staff of Foresight**.Fought a brutal 7-round battle against Ancient Undead** and Champion Mummies**.Casualty:** Kaetherlen** was pulverized into dust. The company returned victorious but mourning a brother.3. The Birthday Blunder:**Hunted a "monstrous" threat outside Eisenstein: an unholy alliance of 14 Webknechts** and a Champion Ancient Soldier**.NeCola** dominated the field (550 damage), while Dauid** "graduated" from fodder status by dying permanently after taking a staggering 378 damage.You ended the contract by flinging a giant spider corpse into Hallstein’s birthday party, collecting 980 crowns** in total.4. Expanding the Ranks:**Moved North to Fuhrtmark**, hearing rumors of Flesh Golems** and mad Stitchers**.Recruited Theudebald** (Vagabond) to fill the ranks and Hiltrude** (Widow) as a desperate 13th member/fodder.5. Moral Fortitude in Ohnemenschen:**Resupplied and wisely declined** a suspicious 1,500-crown "favor" from The Butcher**, avoiding a clear trap.Current Company Ledger**Date:** Day 26, Midday.Roster:** 12/12 (11 Veterans, 1 New Recruit).Key Members:** NeCola** (Champion-Slayer), Godfrey** (Cursed), HiYun** (Right-hand).Treasury:** Strong (after the 780-crown payout and 200-crown advance).Next Goal:** Continuing North to find the source of the "Grafted Flesh" abominations.Safe travels until Session 9, Captain. When you're ready to return, shall we pick up the trail of those "deranged minds" in the northern wilds?\*\*
