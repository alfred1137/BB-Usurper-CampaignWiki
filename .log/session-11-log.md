Session 11 starts now. We start Day 32 morning by packing up to leave WOLKENBURG. There are no more quests I am interested in here. We trek our way back to HAMMARSTED and then HALFDANSTED. Neither towns have anything useful to offer. I told the party that we will next head to VARDEBORG - A large citadel towering high over the surrounding tundra and securing the large and open region. Many come here to resupply, make repairs and rest until venturing on. Our target is the coast, looking to sail our way back south.

Session 11: The Long Trek NorthThe morning air in Wolkenburg** was biting, a reminder that the world owes no man warmth. HiYun** watched the last of the bedrolls being cinched tight. The town had been bled dry of opportunity—no contracts worth the blood they would cost, no rumors worth the coin. With a sharp nod to NeCola**, the order was given. The company moved out.The journey was a monotonous grind of iron-shod boots against frozen earth. They bypassed Hammarsted** and pushed through to Halfdansted**, but the hearths there were cold and the markets empty of quality steel or fresh purpose. The men grumbled in the ranks, their breath misting in the grey light, but HiYun’s gaze remained fixed on the horizon."We move for Vardeborg**," HiYun announced, his voice carrying over the rhythmic clatter of shields.The great citadel soon loomed over the tundra, a jagged crown of stone and timber that dominated the northern wastes. It was a place of respite for some, but for the company, it was merely a waypoint. They reached the towering gates seeking the essentials: a sharp edge for their blades, a patch for their leather, and a moment’s rest before the final push to the coast. The salt-scented air of the south was calling, and Vardeborg was the last bastion of civilization before they sought a ship to carry them away from these desolate lands.

We are at the gate of Vardeborg Day 32 night. As we set camp, we encountered:  ---  Night has settled over the camp, the men busy with their own thoughts as firelight flickers across tired faces and battered gear. It is then that one of your company approaches, hesitating for a moment before speaking. He tells you there is a man at the edge of the camp who insists on seeing you ... an old one, wrapped in dark robes, carrying himself with unsettling calm. No one recalls seeing him approach.  You rise and follow, the sounds of the camp fading as you near the fire's edge. There stands the stranger, leaning upon a staff marked with symbols that seem to shift when not directly observed. His eyes lift to meet yours, and a pressure settles behind them, firm but restrained.  "So this is the one who walks with a bound shadow."  The old man studies you openly, as though reading something written beneath the skin. The weight in your mind eases, though it does not fully leave. "A vattghern does not linger without purpose. It has chosen well. The signs are clear. Forces stir that will not be stopped by steel alone. And you, you are worthy of guidance - of wisdom tempered by age, and strength that endures."  The air feels heavier now, charged with meaning.  "I would stand with your company and help face what is yet to come. The storm approaches, and it would be unwise to meet it alone."  As his words fade, the pressure in your mind loosens its grip, leaving behind an uneasy certainty that the old man speaks the truth ..  ---  We welcomed ABEL THE CONJURER, an OLD SEER, to the company. Though his hands tremble at times, Abel's gaze never wavers. He speaks of events long past as if they happened yesterday, and of future dangers as if he has already faced them. Whether by wisdom, magic, or sheer stubbornness, he remains standing where others have fallen.

Session 11: The Prophet at the GateNight fell heavy over the tundra as the company made camp beneath the shadow of Vardeborg’s** walls. The flickering campfires did little to push back the encroaching gloom of the wastes. HiYun** was settling into the routine of the watch when a brother approached, his voice lowered and uneasy. A stranger had breached the perimeter—not with steel, but with a presence that defied the natural order.HiYun** followed the man to the edge of the light. There, cloaked in robes the color of a bruised sky, stood an old man. His staff was etched with shifting, alien geometries that made the eyes ache. Beside HiYun, NeCola** shifted, her hand instinctively hovering near her weapon as the air grew thick and heavy, a physical pressure mounting behind their brows."So this is the one who walks with a bound shadow," the stranger spoke, his voice a dry rasp that carried a weight far beyond his frail frame.The old man’s gaze pierced through HiYun, acknowledging the vattghern* presence with a chilling familiarity. He spoke of storms that steel could not weather and a destiny that required more than mere mercenary grit. As the psychic pressure ebbed, it left behind a cold, unshakable truth: the path ahead was darkening.The stranger introduced himself as Abel the Conjurer**. Despite his trembling hands and the weathered skin of an Old Seer**, there was a terrifying lucidity in his eyes. He spoke of the future with the weary tone of a man recounting a memory. Recognizing the shift in the winds of fate, HiYun signaled the men to stand down.Abel was brought into the fold. The company gained a seer who looked through the veil of time as easily as a scout looks over a ridge. As the fires died down to embers, the camp felt different—heavier, charged with the presence of one who had already seen how their story might end.

As i return to camp:  ---  The noise catches your ear first ... Laughter, clanking mugs, the unmistakable sound of boots stomping in rhythm. You approach the main campfire to find your men gathered close, flames flickering across eager faces. Someone's carved a crude crest into a log and is holding it up like a royal banner. Stories are flying exaggerated tales of monsters slain, dangers braved, and victories won.  They're icelebrating. Not for coin, not for food, but for fame. Your party's name is spreading, and for once, everyone seems to feel it. You cross your arms, watching the revelry. Spirits are high. Morale is solid. Still ... a little push wouldn't hurt. You consider what you could do to lift the mood even further ...  You raise your hand, and slowly the noise dies down. All eyes turn to you, curious, expectant. You step closer to the fire, its warmth brushing your face as you begin to speak. You don't shout, don't puff your chest. Instead, your voice is steady, thoughtful.  You remind them of where it all began ... that first job that barely paid for bread, the nights spent under leaking tarps, the close calls that could've ended it all before it even started. You speak of green recruits who hadn't yet held steel with steady hands, of patchwork armor and borrowed blades.  And then, you bring them forward. Through the trials, the battles, the losses. Through the beast-hunts, the cursed towns, the midnight escapes. You speak of the strength they've earned, the names they've made for themselves, and the fear they now strike in others.  The fire crackles as you pause. No grand theatrics, no empty bravado, just a quiet truth shared among those who've lived it. Someone raises a mug. Then another. A cheer builds, not wild, but proud ... The kind born of blood and memory.  ---

The chill of the tundra was momentarily forgotten as HiYun** stepped back into the heart of the camp. The air here was thick with the scent of roasted meat and cheap ale, vibrating with the rare, raucous sound of mercenary joy. A crude crest, carved into a fallen log, stood as a makeshift monument to their growing renown. The men weren't just eating; they were feasting on the realization that they were no longer nobodies.NeCola** caught HiYun’s eye from across the flames, a rare, faint smirk touching her lips as the men boasted of scars and silver. The transition from the eerie meeting with Abel to this sudden burst of humanity was jarring, but necessary.HiYun raised a hand. The clatter of mugs subsided, replaced by the crackle of the hearth. He didn't offer a general's roar; he spoke with the grounded gravity of a man who had shared their mud. He spoke of the lean days—the hunger, the rusted gear, and the desperate contracts that had nearly broken them. He traced the line of their journey through the blood spilled and the miles marched, turning their shared hardships into a foundation of pride.As his words hung in the cold night air, the mood shifted from simple revelry to a quiet, hardened solidarity. A single mug went up, then a dozen more. It wasn't the loud, hollow cheer of drunkards, but the steady, resonant acknowledgement of men who knew they were becoming legends.The morale of the company was no longer just a matter of coin and rations. It was forged in the fire of their own history.I can continue the chronicle once you decide to break camp and head for the coast, or if you choose to explore the services within Vardeborg** first.

We break camp the next morning on Day 33. We went into town to sell off some wares and then look for recruitment. We are pass the days when we just pick anyone up as fodders. No, we need capable fighters; and this town has none to offer. We check the market for some food and supplies. We restock our ration and decided to move on. We head for the haboured town of WASSERKOOG - A larger spread out village relying on fishing and a little trade.

Session 11: The North Wind at Our BacksThe morning of Day 33** arrived with a pale, weak sun struggling against the mist. The high spirits of the previous night’s revelry had settled into a quiet, professional resolve as the company struck camp. HiYun** led the procession through the massive gates of Vardeborg**, the iron-shod boots of the brothers ringing out against the stone.Inside the citadel, the air was thick with the smell of coal smoke and wet wool. HiYun and NeCola** moved through the marketplace with a discerning eye. They offloaded the trophies and battered gear collected from their recent travels, the coin clinking satisfyingly into the company coffers. However, the search for fresh blood proved fruitlerss. HiYun walked the line of mercenaries and laborers looking for work, but his gaze remained cold. There were no warriors here—only men looking for a quick death or an easy meal. The company had outgrown the need for fodder; they required steel tempered by experience, and Vardeborg’s offerings were brittle."Nothing here but soft hands and loud mouths," HiYun muttered, turning away from the recruitment posts.After restocking the wagons with salted meats and grain to sustain them through the next leg of the journey, the order was given to depart. They left the towering walls of the citadel behind, turning their backs on the tundra and setting a course for the coast.The destination was Wasserkoog**, a sprawling fishing village known for its nets and its docks. The salt in the air grew stronger with every mile marched, promising a way off the land and onto the waves. The company moved with purpose, the prospect of the southern seas driving them forward as the rugged northern landscape began to give way to the damp, low-lying marshes of the coast.

We found the village in rough shape  ---  DISAPPEARING VILLAGERS Villagers have been disappearing from this town, putting everyone on edge. Fewer locals are to be found on the streets, the belongings of the disappeared have somehow appeared in the markets. Enterprising Ratcatchers and Beast Slayers have also turned up, offering to hunt down the beasts plaguing the settlement in exchange for coin.  ---  TERRIFIED VILLAGERS The villagers here are terrified of unknown horrors. Fewer potential recruits are to be found on the streets, and people deal less favourably with strangers. Those formerly in the business of graves are rightfully seeking new employment. Upon resolution this will refresh the hiring roster in town.  ---  You find ljsbrand of Wasserkoog reading a scroll. He throws the paper at you and asks you to read off the names. The handwriting is difficult, but not moreso than the names themselves. You stop and apologize, stating you are not from these parts. The man nods and takes the scroll back.  "Tis alright, sellsword. If you were wondering, those were the names of men, women, and children who have passed in the last week."  Last week? There were a lot of names on that list. The man, seeming to read you, nods somberly.  "Aye, we are in a bad way. So many lives lost. We believe this to be the work of foul creatures, beasts beyond our ability to reason. Obviously, we'd like you to go find and destroy them. Would you be interested in such a task, mercenary?"  ---  we are tasked to Hunt down what terrorizes Wasserkoog   PAYMENT  Get 320 crowns in advance Get 1290 crowns on completion

## Gemini

Session 11: The Shadows of WasserkoogThe salt air of Wasserkoog** did not bring the relief HiYun** expected. Instead, the village smelled of stagnant water and cold sweat. As the company marched in, the atmosphere was stifling; the usual bustle of a fishing hub was replaced by shuttered windows and hushed whispers. The few locals remaining on the streets watched the mercenaries with eyes widened by a primal, twitchy terror.The signs of decay were everywhere. Belongings of the missing—a child's doll, a fisherman's weathered coat—sat eerily for sale in the market, salvaged from homes now empty. Grave-diggers, once busy, had fled their posts, replaced by grim-faced Ratcatchers and Beast Slayers loitering near the tavern, looking for a way to profit from the carnage.HiYun** was approached by a man named Ijsbrand**, who held a scroll that seemed to weigh more than lead. When HiYun struggled with the unfamiliar names written in a cramped, frantic hand, Ijsbrand took it back with a hollow sigh."Those were the names of men, women, and children who have passed in the last week," the man said, his voice devoid of hope.The list was long—far too long for a village of this size. The "Disappearing Villagers" weren't just fleeing; they were being harvested. Ijsbrand spoke of foul creatures, beasts that defied reason, lurking in the damp mists surrounding the settlement.NeCola** tightened the straps on her greaves as the contract was laid out. The pay was substantial—1,290 crowns to end the nightmare, with 320 upfront to sharpen their steel. HiYun weighed the heavy purse in his hand. The quest for a ship would have to wait. The company had been hired to hunt, and in the dark corners of Wasserkoog, something was waiting to be hunted back.The advance was paid. The company prepared for a trek into the wilds, tracking whatever horrors had turned this village into a graveyard.

We are up against A pack of ferocious direwolves on the hunt for prey:  CHAMPION Direwolf  CHAMPION Possessed Witchhunter (potentially the commander of the pack)  Pack of 14 Direwolves  A Barbarian Beastmaster  A Possessed Billman  ---  A group of small caravan was unfortunately caught in the fight. Haha! meat shields for us!

## Gemini

Session 11: The Blood in the MistThe tracks led away from the sodden outskirts of Wasserkoog** and into the clutching damp of the wilds. The air grew thick with the iron tang of blood and the musk of wet fur. HiYun** signaled the halt as the low, guttural growls echoed through the trees. They hadn't just found a pack; they had found a war party of the wild.Emerging from the fog was a nightmare rendered in fur and steel. A Champion Direwolf**, a beast of impossible size with eyes like dying coals, led a swarming pack of fourteen lesser wolves. But the beasts were not alone. A Barbarian Beastmaster** moved among them, his whip cracking like a thunderclap, while a Possessed Billman** stood unnaturally still, his polearm leveled with ghostly precision. Most disturbing of all was the Champion Possessed Witchhunter**—a man who should have been a protector, now a hollow vessel for something dark, commanding the wolves with silent, psychic malice.A sharp cry drew HiYun’s** attention to the flank. A small merchant caravan, caught in the wrong place at the catastrophic wrong time, was scrambling in terror.HiYun** felt a cold, cynical smirk touch his face. He didn't order a rescue. "Let the beasts choke on the merchants first," he muttered to NeCola**. "Every throat they tear that isn't ours is a breath saved for the company."The merchants' screams filled the air as the wolves lunged, providing a frantic, bloody distraction. While the pack tore into the "meat shields," HiYun drew his blade, his eyes locked on the Witchhunter. The air hummed with Abel's** unsettling presence as the old seer watched the unfolding slaughter. The trap was set, the distraction was dying, and the real fight was about to begin.I can proceed with narrating the combat results once you provide the outcome of the engagement. Should I focus on the clash with the Champions or the slaughter of the pack?

Session 11: Blood on the TundraThe battle was a symphony of snarls and steel that lasted eight grueling rounds. As HiYun** had predicted, the unfortunate caravan served its grim purpose, drawing the initial, frenzied hunger of the pack and allowing the company to form a solid wall of iron.NeCola, the Silver Sword**, was a whirlwind of precision. She moved through the chaos with a lethal grace, her blade shearing through fur and bone alike. By the time the dust settled, four of the beasts lay butchered at her feet, her cloak stained with a spray of dark gore. Beside her, Lady Amelia** and Frethwi** held the line with equal ferocity, each claiming three kills as the direwolves broke themselves against the company’s discipline.Even the newcomer, Abel the Conjurer**, proved his worth. Amidst the howling, he stood unnaturally still, his staff pulsing with an erratic light before a wolf lunged—and collapsed mid-air, its heart stopped by a force unseen.Despite the carnage, the Champion Witchhunter** proved as elusive as a ghost. Realizing the tide had turned, he slipped into the mist, his possessed form vanishing before a finishing blow could be dealt. It was a lingering shadow on an otherwise decisive victory.As the men began the grim work of stripping the fallen, two rare prizes were unearthed from the viscera of the stranger foes: an Ifirit Mutagen** and an Unhold Mutagen**. The pulsating, alchemical remains glowed with an unnatural light in the damp gloom.HiYun** picked them up, the glass vials cold against his palm. He looked over at NeCola**, offering the silent question of whether she wished to augment her already formidable prowess with such volatile essence. She merely rolled her eyes, wiping a streak of blood from her cheek."I'll consider it," she remarked dryly, though her gaze lingered on the vials a moment too long to be true indifference.The beasts were dead, the village's nightmare was over, and the company’s pockets were about to get much heavier.I stand ready to narrate your return to Wasserkoog** to collect the remaining 1,290 crowns, or your next move toward the harbor.

We return to town  ---  When you step in ljsbrand of Wasserkoog's room he recoils almost instantly.  "What in the hells of the gods is in your hand, sellsword?"  You hold up the nape of a pelt. Black blood ropes out from the neck and splatters the floor.  "One of the beasts you were looking for. If you need evidence of the rest, l got those waiting outside ... "  The man holds his hand up, staying you.  "One is sufficient for my belief. Very good work, sellsword. Your pay will be with Abelard, a councilman you probably passed in the halls. He's got the ugly mug on him and he'll be carrying the 1290 crowns, as promised."  The man takes another look at the beast then slowly shakes his head.  ---

Session 11: The Price of SafetyThe stench of the camp followed HiYun** into the village, a thick musk of wet fur and coagulated blood that seemed to cling to his very armor. When he entered the chambers of Ijsbrand**, the air of the room instantly curdled. The man recoiled, his face paling as he stared at the grisly trophy dangling from HiYun’s hand.Black, viscous blood—thick and oily—dripped from the mangled nape of the direwolf pelt, splashing onto the clean floor with a heavy thud*."One of the beasts you were looking for," HiYun stated, his voice flat and devoid of the adrenaline that still hummed through the rest of the company. "If you need evidence of the rest, I’ve got them waiting outside."Ijsbrand raised a trembling hand, averting his eyes from the dead monster. "One is sufficient for my belief," he stammered, the horror of what had been stalking his people finally made manifest in the gore on his rug.He directed HiYun toward a councilman named Abelard to collect the remaining 1,290 crowns**. The transaction was as cold and professional as the hunt itself. The gold was heavy, a fair trade for the lives of the beasts and the "meat shields" left rotting in the mist.As they walked back through the halls, NeCola** glanced at the heavy coin purses. The villagers were still terrified, and the Witchhunter was still out there, but for now, the company was rich and the contract was closed. The road to the docks was open, and the salt spray of the coast felt closer than ever.I am ready to narrate the company's next move. Shall we seek a ship in Wasserkoog** to begin the journey south, or is there more business to attend to in this scarred village?

And that's everything going for us up in the north. I told the company we are sailing south to Ka-Sabar. Many of them have not been to the South, especially our Vala and our Seer. With me, our company member will travel the world far beyond their peers would. For about a thousand crown, we find ourselves on a different part of the world. The snow is replaced by the sand.  At the habour of Ka-Sabar, I told our members to pair up and explore the town. NeCola and I went for a drink. There, a belly dancer offer to perform her amazing skills with blade dancing. Apparantly its a martial art in the far east. I toss her a crown.  ---  After the belly dancer takes your crown you wait around for the show to end. You approach as she picks up daggers and coins. She looks at you with a wry smile.  "Ah, an admirer. Sorry, only one show tonight, darling."  You shake your head and ask if she knows anything about fighting. She nods.  "The Gilded One's gleam is upon us all, but not at all hours or days. Sometimes, we must find our own way through the dark. I take it by your dress that you are a Crownling, putting that blade of yours where it does and sometimes does not belong."  You nod and ask her if she'd be interested in joining. She drops, bowlegged, and sinks to the ground like a collapsing truss. She counts her crowns.  "I'm not sure if you have a good eye for the wandering nature of ones such as myself. Perhaps there is a certain ... recognition, for those of us willing to kill for what we want. That said, you'll have to try harder to get me to go around killing for coin ... "  You offer five hundred crowns to the dancer. She keeps picking up the coins from her performance- one at a time - and putting them in her clay pot. It is almost a silent affair, coins clapping loudly as they fall into a nearly empty barrel of clay. She looks up, looks down. She puts in one more crown then gets to her feet. She strips off her clothes and holds out her hand.  "The Gilded One must be gleaming upon us both, for you to have earned such keep, and no doubt He has guided your purse here to bring it to me."  You nod and shake her hand. The dancer asks that she take a look at your inventory.  "A body like mine, anything will fit, inside or out, I'Il make it work."   ---  Her BACKGROUND: BELLY DANCER. We found Sadiya E in Ka-Sabar, masked by green silk and drawing crowds with rhythmic movements and impressively precise fruit slicing. The latter skill is a boon to any mercenary company, and so you didn't hesitate to recruit them .

Session 11: From Snow to SandThe transition was as jarring as a blow to the head. One thousand crowns bought the company passage away from the biting frost of the north, trading the grey mists of the tundra for the blinding gold of the south. As the ship pulled into the harbor of Ka-Sabar**, the heat hit them like a physical wall. HiYun** watched the Vala** and Abel the Conjurer**; the seer’s eyes narrowed against the desert glare, perhaps seeing a different set of ghosts in the shimmering heat haze."Pair up. See the city, but keep your hands on your purses," HiYun ordered.While the men wandered the sun-drenched markets, HiYun** and NeCola** sought the shade of a local tavern. The air inside was thick with the scent of jasmine and heavy spices. In the center of the room, a woman moved with a fluidity that blurred the line between art and violence. Sadiya**, a Belly Dancer** masked in shimmering green silk, performed the "blade dance" of the far east, her daggers slicing through the air—and fruit—with terrifying precision.HiYun tossed a crown, but his interest wasn't in the performance; it was in the martial lethality hidden behind the rhythm.After the show, the air between them was thick with the silent appraisal of two killers. Sadiya was cynical, her wry smile suggesting she’d seen a thousand "Crownlings" come and go. But when HiYun produced a purse of five hundred crowns, the rhythmic clink-clank* of her meager earnings hitting her clay pot was replaced by the heavy thud of mercenary gold.In a move of sudden, desert-born pragmatism, she stripped of her silks and held out her hand, ready to trade the dancer's stage for the mercenary's march."The Gilded One must be gleaming upon us both," she remarked, her eyes already scanning the company’s gear with a professional's greed. "A body like mine, anything will fit... I'll make it work."With Sadiya** now added to the roster, her precise blade-work promised to be a bloody boon to the company. The snow was a memory; the desert awaited.The company is now gathered in the bustling heat of Ka-Sabar**. I am standing by for your next move—whether you wish to browse the exotic southern markets, seek a contract from the Viziers, or prepare Sadiya for her first taste of mercenary combat.

With our newest member, we walked around town.  ---  As you move through the town's muddy streets, your nose catches a sharp, acrid scent that cuts through the usual reek of livestock and sweat. Turning a corner, you nearly stumble into a man hunched over a bundle of bloodied cloths and bones, muttering to himself. His hair is a wild thicket of grey, and his robe is stitched together from so many different patches that it looks like a skinwalker's disguise. He peers up at you through round, fogged spectacles, his eyes glittering with a manic energy.  " Ah, a mercenary! Perfect, perfect. You have what I need, yes? Fresh samples, sinew, rare bone formations? "  Without waiting for your reply, he circles you, sniffing like a hound.  " That specimen there, the Ifrit Mutagen, magnificent! A real marvel. I'Il give you 4051 crowns for it. No haggling, no questions. Only science! "  ---  I looked at NeCola and she was like "get rid of that please". 4k crowns is a great deal indeed. We will take it

Session 11: The Madman’s RansomThe heat of Ka-Sabar** had a way of drawing out the strange and the desperate. As the company navigated the crowded, sun-baked streets, a scent sharper than any spice caught HiYun’s** attention—the stinging, chemical reek of alchemy and decay.They were intercepted by a man who seemed more patchwork than human. His robes were a frantic tapestry of scavenged scraps, and his eyes, magnified to unsettling proportions by thick, fogged spectacles, darted with the fire of obsession. This was a man who lived in the margins of biology and madness.He didn't see a mercenary captain; he saw a walking laboratory."Fresh samples, sinew, rare bone formations?" he chirped, circling HiYun with the twitchy movements of a desert lizard. He stopped dead, his nose twitching near the pouch where the Ifirit Mutagen** was stowed. "That specimen there... magnificent! I’ll give you 4,051 crowns** for it. No haggling! Only science!"The offer hung in the air, absurdly high for a jar of glowing sediment. HiYun glanced at NeCola**. She didn't share the alchemist's wonder; she looked at the mutagen with a flare of disgust, her hand waving away the acrid scent."Get rid of that, please," she muttered, her eyes lingering on the heavy purse the madman was already fumbling to produce.HiYun didn't need further convincing. The mutagen was a curiosity, but 4,051 crowns was a small fortune—enough to keep the company fed, armed, and paid for weeks of desert travel. He handed over the vial, and the alchemist clutched it to his chest as if it were a holy relic, scurrying back into the shadows of the alleyway.The weight in HiYun's pouch had tripled in a single transaction. The South was proving to be as profitable as it was scorching.The company’s coffers are overflowing. With Sadiya** integrated and the mutagen sold, the merchants of Ka-Sabar** likely have much to offer. I await your next command.

At the town square, while waiting the rest of the group to return to me. I spotted an interesting INDEBTED. I bought him off from his slave master for 700 crowns. I see great potential in him in becoming a good backliner.  ---  Much of the southern city states float atop the expendable bodies of prisoners of war, criminals, and indebted, throngs of people who have slighted the Gilder or His followers and must 'earn' salvation through hard work. Yared is one such unfortunate soul. Yared swears he is from the north, but the deserts of the south have left him darkly tanned and, frankly, you've not much reason to believe the words of a former prisoner of war no matter where he's from. You hope Yared could make a sound sellsword, but you have the feeling his primary allegiance is to that which any man wishes to taste: freedom.

Session 11: The Gilded Price of FreedomThe town square of Ka-Sabar** was a cacophony of commerce and misery, where the sun beat down on silk and shackles alike. While waiting for the company to regroup, HiYun’s** gaze drifted to the lines of the Indebted**—men whose lives were measured in the debt they owed to the Gilder.Among the throngs of broken spirits, one man stood out. Yared**.Though he was darkly tanned by the relentless southern sun, Yared claimed a lineage from the north—a story HiYun took with a grain of salt. In the South, truth was often the first thing lost to the sands. However, there was a steadiness in the man’s stance, a latent potential in his reach that suggested he could master the long-axe or the pike.For 700 crowns**—a mere fraction of the windfall from the mad alchemist—HiYun bought the man’s debt.NeCola** watched as the shackles were struck from Yared’s wrists. The man rubbed his bruised skin, his eyes not filled with gratitude, but with the sharp, flickering light of a man who finally saw a path to liberty. As HiYun noted, Yared’s primary allegiance wasn't to the company or the coin, but to the freedom he had tasted once more."Keep an eye on that one," HiYun remarked quietly as Yared was sent to the quartermaster for a proper gambeson. "A man who fights for his own soul is a dangerous tool."The company was growing—a northern seer, a southern blade-dancer, and now an indebted seeking his lost heritage. The party was a motley collection of the world's fringes, held together by HiYun’s lead and the promise of southern gold.With the ranks bolstered and the coffers full, the heat of the afternoon begins to wane. I am ready for your next move—will you seek an audience with the Viziers for a contract, or perhaps look to the docks once more?

on to taking some employment  ---  You find Galind Al-Tahir the Vizier of Treasury feeding a bird in a cage. The bird is a collage of colors some of which you're not sure you have even seen before. Suspecting your presence, or perhaps smelling it, Galind Al-Tahir the Vizier of Treasury turns with a hint of disgust.  "You are scaring my bird, Crownling, so I will make this brief for her sake. There are nomads roaming the peripheral of my lands and I need them destroyed. I'm sure a man of your, eh, station, would be willing to undertake such a simple, easy task?"  ---  We will head west to deal with the nomads  OBJECTIVES Drive off nomads at Sandcovered Remnants west of Ka-Sabar  PAYMENT Get 250 crowns in advance Get 1000 crowns on completion

## Gemini

Session 11: The Gilded ContractThe air in the Vizier’s chambers was heavy with the scent of expensive incense and the frantic chirping of a captured bird. Galind Al-Tahir**, a man whose silk robes cost more than a commoner's life, didn't even look at HiYun** as he fed the iridescent creature. His disdain for the "Crownling" mercenaries was as palpable as the desert heat."You are scaring my bird," the Vizier remarked, his voice smooth and dripping with condensation. He spoke of the nomads as if they were a common pestilence—vermin on the edges of his vast treasury.The task was simple: ride west to the Sandcovered Remnants** and eradicate the nomads clinging to the ruins like desert thorns. For 1,000 crowns, and a meager 250 upfront, the Vizier bought the company’s steel to keep his borders clean.HiYun** took the advance, his face a mask of stoic professionalism. He knew these "simple" tasks in the desert often led to blood-soaked sand, but with the company bolstered and the coffers full, a hunt in the dunes was exactly what they needed to blood the new recruits.The company moved out, heading west as the sun began its long descent. The shifting dunes ahead hid the Sandcovered Remnants**, where the nomads awaited. NeCola** checked the edge of her blade, while Sadiya** adjusted her silks, her daggers gleaming in the dying light. The hunt was on.I stand ready to narrate the arrival at the Sandcovered Remnants** and the ensuing clash with the nomads. Shall we proceed to the ruins?

We reached by dawn our destination.  ---  You charge the camp just in time to see a man in black clothes step out of one of the tents. He is shaking hands with the nomads' leader which is probably not the best sign. Both men pausing mid- handshake and staring at your attack is presumably just as sour a result. The nomad leader calls out, demanding his assassins earn their keep. The blackened killer nods and draws out a blade, and a troop of fellow assassins stream out of the tent in turn to join the nomads in the battle!  ---  we are up against  2 champion Nomad Cutthroat   A few Assassins  Several Nomad Cutthroats  A few Nomad Outlaws  Some Nomad Archers  A Nomad Leader

## Gemini

Session 11: The Serpent’s HandshakeThe sun began to bleed over the horizon, turning the Sandcovered Remnants** into a jagged silhouette of scorched stone. HiYun** timed the assault for dawn, hoping to catch the nomads in the lethargy of sleep. But as the company crested the final dune and charged the camp, they found more than just desert raiders.In the center of the camp, a man clad in midnight-black silks was firmly shaking the hand of the Nomad Leader**. The sight of a high-level transaction mid-execution chilled the air. As the company bore down, the handshake broke. The man in black—an Assassin**—gave a curt nod to the leader. At a single whistle, a troop of shadowed killers streamed out from the tents, their blades coated in the dull sheen of desert poisons."Assassins," NeCola** hissed, her hand tightening on the Silver Sword.The battlefield was instantly crowded. Two Champion Nomad Cutthroats**, their armor adorned with the trophies of a dozen caravans, moved to the flanks. Behind them, a line of Nomad Archers** notched arrows, while Outlaws** and Cutthroats** formed a jagged front. The Nomad Leader** stood his ground, barking orders as the black-clad killers vanished into the morning shadows, seeking the soft gaps in the company's line.HiYun** raised his shield. This was no longer a simple clearing of "vermin" for the Vizier; it was a clash with the desert's most lethal shadow-players. Abel the Conjurer** stood behind the front line, his staff glowing with a sickly light as he sensed the murderous intent of the hidden assassins.The sand, already red from the dawn, was about to drink its fill.The company is engaged. I am ready for the combat logs—will the new recruits Sadiya** and Yared** hold their ground against the precision of the assassins, or will the nomad champions break the line?

Session 11: The Price of the SandThe battle at the Sandcovered Remnants** was a grueling ten-round descent into chaos. The nomads fought with the desperation of cornered animals, but they were ultimately no match for the sheer lethality of the Silver Sword. NeCola** was a vision of butcher’s grace, carving through the opposition to claim eight lives, her blade a constant, shimmering arc of death that accounted for nearly half the enemy forces.However, the desert’s sting is treacherous. While Godfrey** and Thordis** held their sections of the line, the enemy's archers rained jagged iron into the company’s heart. HiYun** himself was battered in the melee, taking heavy blows as he shielded the less armored brothers.The most devastating blow, however, was silent. A stray arrow, arching high over the shield wall, found its mark with sickening precision. It struck Abel the Conjurer** directly in the knee, the arrowhead shattering bone into a useless spray of splinters. The old seer collapsed, his staff clattering against the stone.As the last of the assassins lay dead and the nomads were wiped from the ruins, the company gathered around the fallen mystic. HiYun** knelt by Abel, his hands humming with the dark, familiar pull of the Abyssal arts, but he shook his head in grim realization. This was not a wound of the spirit or a simple rent in the flesh; the bone was ruined, beyond the reach of his current magics.In any other company, such a wound would mean a mercy killing or a lonely walk into the dunes. But Abel, his face etched with a new, permanent layer of pain, gripped his shifting staff and forced himself upright."I will carry on," Abel rasped, his eyes glowing with a renewed, defiant intensity. "The flesh is a failing vessel. I will use the winds to guide my stride where bone cannot."By sheer force of will and eldritch manipulation, the seer remained standing. The company had cleared the remnants, but the cost was written in Abel's hobbled gait. They had the nomads' heads and the Vizier’s gold waiting, but the "simple task" had left its mark on the soul of the company.With the nomads destroyed and Abel permanently scarred, the walk back to Ka-Sabar** will be a slow one. Would you like me to narrate the return to Galind Al-Tahir** to collect your 1,000 crowns, or shall we tend to the wounded in the ruins first?

A servant heads you off from meeting Galind Al-Tahir the Vizier of Treasury. He hands you a scroll as well as a satchel. Despite having already handed you the paper, the servant puts his hands behind his back and looks at the ceiling as he recites.  "The Crownling is rewarded 1000 crowns as per prior arrangements. Having taken his reward, he is dismissed from the property posthaste."  The servant looks down at you and nods.  "Leave."  He says.

Session 11: The Gilded Cold ShoulderThe return to Ka-Sabar** was a grim procession. The sun beat down on Abel’s** shattered knee, each step a testament to the old man's agony and his terrifying resolve to remain upright through sheer sorcery. Yet, upon reaching the palace to claim the blood-earned gold, the company was met not with the Vizier’s gratitude, but with the cold efficiency of a servant.Before HiYun** could even cross the threshold of the treasury, he was intercepted. The servant held out a scroll and a heavy satchel of 1,000 crowns** with the practiced indifference of someone disposing of refuse."The Crownling is rewarded... as per prior arrangements," the servant droned, his eyes fixed on the ornate ceiling as if acknowledging HiYun's existence was beneath him. "Having taken his reward, he is dismissed from the property posthaste."The dismissal was as sharp as a desert blade. The servant looked down, his gaze devoid of empathy. "Leave."NeCola**’s hand tightened on the hilt of the Silver Sword, her eyes narrowing at the insult, but HiYun merely weighed the satchel in his hand. The Vizier didn't want the stench of blood—nomad or mercenary—lingering in his halls.They had been used as a broom to sweep the desert clean, and now they were being cast out into the heat. With the gold secured and Abel's new, uneven gait marking their path, the company turned away from the palace. The "Gilded One" might have gleamed on their purses, but the South had shown its true face: a place where life was cheap, and even a legend-in-the-making was just another Crownling to be discarded.The company stands in the bustling streets of Ka-Sabar**, dismissed and wealthy, but scarred. I am standing by for your next move—do you seek a healer for the wounded, or perhaps a ship to take you further along the coast?

The last battle was tough. I decided to let the company set camp and rest up. That was until the same evening of Day 34. we break camp and take on another quest:  ---  Wahib Al-Faradi the High Priest sits at a newly furnished table of gold and acacia, every facet is intricately hand carved and detailed, the corners are inlaid with gold and small jewels. On the surface however is more contradictory - a severed arm, roughly cut at the elbow, flops lifelessly on the ornate table. Wahib Al-Faradi the High Priest is surrounded by equally curious men who poke and prod at the limb like a child would poke at a dead dog with a stick. One of the servants taps the Vizier on the shoulder, where he promptly recomposes himself to seem as uninterested as possible in the diseased meat that is now emitting bile across his table.  "Now Crownling - I do have something quite special for you today. The fleshed dead have been seen in the desert, attacking my land and my servants. They are rarity around here, and one we feel should be dealt with immediately."  ---  OBJECTIVES Hunt down the dead that roam the desert around Ka-Sabar  PAYMENT  Get 500 crowns in advance Get 2000 crowns on completion  ---  we will hunt the haunted over night

## Gemini

Session 11: The Taint in the TreasuryThe rest was short-lived. By the evening of Day 34**, the company was summoned back into the presence of power—this time to the chambers of Wahib Al-Faradi, the High Priest**. The setting was a grotesque contrast of southern opulence and charnel horror.Upon a table of acacia wood, shimmering with gold and inlaid jewels, lay a severed arm. It was a grey, bloated thing, hacked at the elbow and leaking a foul, yellow bile across the ornate carvings. The High Priest and his council poked at the rotting limb with the morbid curiosity of children until HiYun** entered."Now, Crownling," the High Priest said, masking his morbid fascination with a veneer of bored authority. "The fleshed dead have been seen in the desert... They are a rarity around here, and one we feel should be dealt with immediately."The "fleshed dead"—the Wiedergängers** of the north were a known horror, but here in the shifting sands, they were a jagged anomaly. The High Priest offered a substantial bounty for their eradication: 2,000 crowns**, with a heavy 500 upfront**.HiYun** took the coin, the weight of the gold doing little to ease the prickle of unease at the back of his neck. Beside him, Abel the Conjurer** leaned heavily on his staff, his eyes fixed on the rotting arm with a knowing, weary dread. To a man who walked with a bound shadow, the dead were never just a "rarity"—they were a herald.The company marched out into the cooling desert night. The silver moonlight turned the dunes into a landscape of bone and shadow. They were no longer hunting men or beasts; they were hunting the haunted. Under the cover of darkness, the search for the walking corpses of Ka-Sabar** began.The company is tracking the undead through the midnight dunes. I am ready to narrate the encounter once you provide the nature of the "fleshed dead" and the results of the night-hunt.

We found our foe the next morning on Day 35.  ---  After the long journey you finally arrive at the group of undead you have been tracking, curiously, the dead are covered in glistening gold and bronze. Swimming around in circles at the base of a dune the group has clearly become distracted by something nearby or have lost their intended target a few hours ago.  An uneasy feeling builds in your stomach as one by one, the dead form up into a fighting line. Now motionless and attentive, the dead stand ready with their mantles, ear rings and adornments, a size too large, shifting loosely in the wind from their desiccated remains.  A better decorated corpse lets out a mournful howl and the column of dried skin and gold begins to advance.  ---  EMBALMED - Glints of gold and heavy steps serve as a warning to all.   Champion: Embalmed Priest  Champion: Embalmed Soldier  Champion: Embalmed Soldier  A few Embalmed Slaves  Pack of Embalmed Soldiers

## Gemini

Session 11: The Gilded DeadThe dawn of Day 35** brought no warmth, only a harsh, flat light that revealed the true nature of the horror stalking the dunes. As the company crested a massive sand drift, they found their quarry. These were not the ragged, rotting corpses of the north. These were the Embalmed**—ancient remains preserved by salt, spice, and dark ritual, now draped in the heavy, clashing finery of a forgotten era.Glistening gold and tarnished bronze adorned their desiccated limbs. At the base of the dune, the group had been circling aimlessly, their oversized jewelry clattering against bone, until the scent of the living hit the air.The transformation was chilling. One by one, the corpses ceased their wandering and snapped into a rigid, professional fighting line. These were soldiers who remembered their drills even after the flesh had turned to parchment. At the center stood a Champion Embalmed Priest**, his robes stiff with dried gore and sacred oils, flanked by two Champion Embalmed Soldiers** whose bronze plate gleamed with a malevolent light.The Priest let out a hollow, mournful howl—a sound like wind rushing through a tomb—and the column began its steady, rhythmic advance.HiYun** felt the weight of the moment. The "fleshed dead" were silent, relentless, and armored in the wealth of a dead kingdom. Abel**, leaning on his staff, narrowed his eyes at the Priest, sensing the ancient sorcery animating the gold-clad husks. NeCola** stepped forward, her Silver Sword reflecting the morning sun, ready to see if ancient bronze could withstand northern steel.The "Embalmed" trait was clear: these were no mere zombies. Their steps were heavy, their ranks disciplined, and their presence an affront to the desert's peace. The company braced for the impact of the dead.The ancient line is closing in. I am ready for the combat results—will the company’s steel break the bronze of the Embalmed, or will the Priest’s dark influence claim more than just Abel’s mobility?

Session 11: Dust and DecadenceThe clash of steel against ancient bronze rang out across the dunes for eight grueling rounds. The Embalmed** fought with a mechanical, tireless precision that strained the company’s endurance. Their desiccated skin was as tough as cured leather, and the weight of their golden ornaments made every blow they landed feel like the fall of a hammer.NeCola, the Silver Sword**, once again proved why she is the company’s premier dealer of death. She moved like a flickering shadow between the heavy steps of the Embalmed Soldiers**, her blade finding the gaps in their bronze plating to claim five kills. Lady Amelia** and Frethwi** anchored the center, their armor battered but their resolve unbroken as they systematically dismantled the ancient phalanx.Even the new recruit, Sadiya**, found her rhythm. Her daggers, usually reserved for fruit and street performance, bit deep into the preserved flesh of a gold-clad soldier, proving her "blade dancing" was just as effective against the dead as the living.The Embalmed Priest** was a terrifying center for the enemy, its mournful howls buffeting the minds of the men, but HiYun** pushed through the psychic haze. With a heavy, singular strike, he personally ended the life of one of the shambling horrors, his own dark power flickering in response to the ancient magic he was extinguishing.The battlefield was a mess of shattered bone, tarnished jewelry, and spilled spice. Abel**, still hindered by his ruined knee, could do little more than survive the chaos, his eyes reflecting the exhaustion of a man who had seen too much. Yared** and Thordis** took their share of bruises, the "heavy steps" of the dead leaving them gasping for air in the thin desert heat.As the last of the gilded corpses collapsed into the sand, the silence returned to the desert—save for the heavy breathing of the company and the clinking of the loot being gathered from the remains. The "rarity" the High Priest spoke of was dead, but the effort had drained the men to their marrow.The haunted dead are back in the earth, and their gold is in your bags. I stand ready to narrate your return to Wahib Al-Faradi** in Ka-Sabar** to collect the remaining 2,000 crowns**.

As the last of the embalmed are slain their jewelry jingles and chimes as they fall into the soft sand. A nauseating feeling comes over you, as if you have not slept for months or had water for days, your skin feels thinner and your bones creak and pull away at one another. After a few moments the feeling passes and your strength returns.  Your concern now shifts to the dozen or so corpses littering the battlefield. The Vizier wanted proof and you will provide it with more than a mere arm. You find the most resplendent embalmed slumped in a pile and take off the head with a few precise cuts, headdress and all. Strapping it to your belt you begin to make the long journey home with your new prize - but not before taking some of the jewelry for the trouble.  ---  At Ka Sabar  You stride into the Vizier's main chamber, dutifully placing the head on the table where the arm once sat. A servant in the far corner with a stained rag lets out a miserable sigh and exits the room. The Vizier inspects the head closely from their seat.  "It is done?"  You nod in response. At another corner of the room, guards and servants briefly intermingle, swapping money and curses alike.  "I have not seen anything like this before crownling - but if the threat is dealt with then you may leave with your reward."  He motions you to leave and a servant hurriedly drops a pouch of crowns in your hands. A thought crosses your mind that the gold from the headdress was likely worth double than what you were paid. Meanwhile, a guard approaches the head and skewers it through the eye socket with their spear, carrying it off to the next room.  As you begin to leave, you hear a loud curse and a dull thud of flesh on a hard floor, followed by girlish screams of nobles. You take the time to count your coins while eavesdropping on the dramatic events in the next room, then leave once you are satisfied with both.  ---

Session 11: The Gilded CurseThe moment the last of the Embalmed fell, the desert fell into a suffocating, unnatural silence. As their heavy jewelry settled into the sand with a final, mocking chime, a wave of profound sickness washed over HiYun**. It was as if the very essence of age and desiccation had leapt from the corpses to the living—skin tightening like parchment, bones groaning with a sudden, brittle weight. Beside him, NeCola** braced herself against her sword, and even Abel** seemed to wither further.The sensation passed as quickly as a desert mirage, leaving only a lingering tremor. HiYun did not linger on the supernatural foulness; he had a contract to close. With a few precise, wet cuts, he severed the head of the most ornate priest, headdress and all. It was a grisly trophy, heavy with the weight of gold and ancient sin. After stripping the most valuable trinkets from the rest of the dead for "trouble," the company began the long march back to Ka-Sabar**.The return to the High Priest’s chambers was a study in grim irony. HiYun** strode past the opulent hangings and placed the severed, gold-crowned head exactly where the rotting arm had been. The servant with the cleaning rag took one look at the new mess, sighed with the weight of a man whose work would never end, and walked out.Wahib Al-Faradi** leaned in, his curiosity outweighing his disgust. "It is done?"HiYun gave a curt nod. In the shadows of the room, guards and servants were whispering, settling bets on whether the mercenaries would return at all. The High Priest seemed unsettled by the sight of the embalmed nobility, but he motioned for the payment. A servant hurriedly dropped the 2,000 crowns** into HiYun’s hands, desperate to usher the "Crownlings" out.As HiYun turned to leave, he saw a guard casually skewer the priest's head through the eye socket with a spear to carry it away. But the company didn't make it to the gates before the palace’s polished veneer cracked.From the adjacent room came a loud, panicked curse, followed by the unmistakable, wet thud* of heavy flesh hitting the floor. Then, the shrill, terrified screams of noblewomen tore through the air. HiYun paused, his fingers slowly counting the gold in his pouch, a cold smile playing on his lips as the sounds of chaos erupted behind him. Whatever the palace guard had unleashed by disrespecting the dead was no longer his concern.The coin was counted. The "dramatic events" were a free show.The company is back in the streets of Ka-Sabar**, the palace in an uproar behind you. With your pockets bursting and the "Gilded Dead" contract closed, I am ready for your next move. Shall we look for a way out of this cursed city before the guards decide to blame the mercenaries for the screaming?

Session 11: The Sultan of SlothThe air in the chambers of Yazid Al-Sabbag** was thick with the cloying scent of musk and overripe fruit. The Vizier of Trade did not sit upon a chair of wood or stone, but reclined atop a living throne of silken cushions and the intertwined limbs of his harem. He moved with a sluggish, oily grace, raising a hand to halt HiYun’s** approach as if the mere proximity of a mercenary was an affront to his comfort."If you step further, Crownling, then you will grow in sight but diminish in view, understand?" Yazid drawled, his voice muffled by the luxury surrounding him. "A smart man knows his place."He spoke of the nomads to the north-east as one might speak of a persistent itch. They had moved into the Blazing Sun Camp**, disrupting the flow of his precious trade. To Yazid, their lives were a nuisance; to the company, they were a payday. The offer was the most "handsome handsel" yet: 2,290 crowns** upon completion, with a generous 570 upfront**.HiYun** caught the glint of steel in NeCola’s** eyes. The arrogance of the southern lords was grating, but their gold was pure. He accepted the advance, the coins heavy in his palm, and led the company back out into the blistering heat.The target was the Blazing Sun Camp**. As the company turned north-east, leaving the perfumed halls of the Vizier behind, the desert wind began to howl, kicking up grit that stung the skin. They were hunting men who had dared to make a Vizier "uncomfortable"—a crime that, in the desert, was usually punished with a slow death under the sun.The company is marching toward the Blazing Sun Camp**. I am ready to narrate the confrontation once you provide the strength of the nomad forces and the outcome of the raid.

We arrived by night at the camp  ---  Shredded tents. Baskets unwoven. Clothes rolling across the sands. And in the middle of it all sits a man in a black cloak, his ghastly face peering from its hooded shade.  "You are both late and right on time."  He says and gets to his feet. The tarps rustle, the baskets tilt, and the clothes jerk aside, the land riffling with liveliness. Suddenly, the sand slips into cavernous channels and inimical nomads empty from the earth, climbing out, some leaping forth as though to revivify themselves on fresh air, others tilting upward from heel to toe, bodies straight like flagpoles. They move unnervingly, stilted and tilted, and the man in black grins behind their shambling formation. He is no ordinary blaggard, but a necromancer!  ---  35 enemies including 4 champions and a Basilisk! So many zombies!

Session 11: The Sand-Grave's HarvestThe Blazing Sun Camp** was a graveyard before the first blow was even struck. Under the cold, uncaring moonlight, the company found only ruin—shredded silk and wind-blown debris. But as HiYun** signaled the halt, the "man in black" emerged from the center of the wreckage. He wasn't a trader or a nomad; he was a master of the charnel arts."You are both late and right on time," the Necromancer rasped, his voice a dry rattle.At his word, the very desert seemed to vomit forth its dead. In a grotesque display of "revivification," the sand shifted into cavernous pits as nomads—long dead and preserved by the salt—leaped or tilted upward from the earth. Some stood straight as flagpoles, their movements stilted and unnatural, eyes clouded by the Necromancer’s will.The scale of the ambush was staggering. Thirty-five enemies** clawed their way into the moonlight. Among the throngs of the "fleshed dead" were four Champions**, their ancient gear rattling as they took their places in the formation. But the true horror was the Basilisk**—a creature of nightmare hissed and skittered at the flank, its presence a testament to the Necromancer's far-reaching corruption.HiYun** drew his blade, the dark magic within him reacting to the sheer volume of necromancy saturating the air. NeCola** stepped into her stance, the Silver Sword humming in the quiet night. Behind them, Abel the Conjurer** leaned on his staff, his eyes reflecting the flickering blue fire of the Necromancer’s spells.The desert was no longer just sand; it was a sea of reaching hands and ancient, stilted warriors. The company was outnumbered, surrounded by the shambling results of a Vizier's "simple task."The moon is high, and the dead are legion. I am ready for the combat logs of this massive engagement—will the company weather the storm of thirty-five foes and the gaze of the Basilisk, or will they join the "stilted" ranks of the Blazing Sun?

Session 11: The Seventeen Rounds of SandThe night air of the Blazing Sun Camp** became a suffocating soup of dust, necromantic bile, and the relentless ring of steel. Seventeen rounds. For nearly an hour of objective time, the company stood in a tightening circle as the desert literally tried to swallow them whole.NeCola** and Lady Amelia** were the twin pillars of the slaughter, each claiming six of the shambling horrors. NeCola’s Silver Sword** carved through the "stilted" nomads with such ferocity that she dealt over 2,300 damage** alone—a whirlwind of gore that kept the Necromancer’s champions at bay.The new recruits proved their mettle in the crucible. Sadiya**, the belly dancer, transformed her rhythmic movements into a deadly cadence, her blades finding the soft rot of four undead targets. Yared**, fighting with the desperation of a man who refused to be enslaved by death itself, matched her with four kills of his own. Even Godfrey** was a titan in the sands, his strikes landing with enough force to shatter the ancient, brittle bones of the "flagpole" corpses.The Basilisk** hissed and lunged through the chaos, but the company’s discipline held. Wilfried** and Imamaddin** took the brunt of the physical toll, their armor battered and their bodies bruised as they stood as a bulwark against the tide.By the seventeenth round, the Necromancer realized his "fresh air" revivification had failed. The desert was littered with twice-dead corpses, and the stench of charred magic hung heavy. Seeing his champions dismantled and his horde thinned, the black-cloaked figure dissolved into the shadows of the dunes, his remaining thralls scattering into the wastes.The company stood alone in the ruins, chests heaving, boots caked in a mixture of sand and black ichor. They had survived a small army.Aftermath: The Vizier’s DueThe walk back to Ka-Sabar** will be silent and weary. You have more than earned the 2,290 crowns** from the Vizier of Trade, though after facing a Necromancer and thirty-five dead, his cushions and harems will likely look even more distasteful.Would you like to head straight to Yazid Al-Sabbag** to demand your pay, or is it time to finally let the company find a tavern to wash the grave-dust from their throats?

I told the party to set camp inside of the necro hideout. It will give them time to rest and repair, while I study the corpse we have gathered.  As we settle down, I looked to NeCola. "I think it's time," I said. "For what exactly?" She asked. "The unhold mutation," I replied without hesitations, "it will take you, us, to the next level". She turned to look at the rest of the group. "yah they handled themselves very well in the recent fights," she agreed. She grabbed the bottle, drank it, and frowned. I know it will take her quite a few days to recover from this. So my first order of business is to tend to her sickness, before autopsy.  ---  By the time we are ready to move, it is afternoon of Day 36. NeCola will take 3-5 more days before truely recover from her second mutation. From the corpses, I extracted a strange large red worm out of one of the necromancers.  We started trekking back to town.

He hands you a scroll as well as a satchel. Despite having already handed you the paper, the servant puts his hands behind his back and looks at the ceiling as he recites.  "The Crownling is rewarded 2290 crowns as per prior arrangements. Having taken his reward, he is dismissed from the property posthaste."  The servant looks down at you and nods.  "Leave."  He says.

Session 11: The Alchemy of AmbitionThe air in the necromancer's hideout was cold, smelling of stale incense and old death, but it offered a perverse sanctuary. While the company collapsed into a well-earned slumber and began the tedious work of scouring black ichor from their gear, HiYun** turned his attention to the future of the company’s lethality.He held the Unhold Mutagen** up to the flickering torchlight. It was a thick, volatile liquid that seemed to pulse with a life of its own."I think it's time," HiYun said, his voice cutting through the quiet.
NeCola** wiped a streak of dried gore from her brow. "For what exactly?"
"The Unhold mutation," he replied. "It will take you—us—to the next level."NeCola surveyed the sleeping forms of the company—Sadiya**, Yared**, and the battered Abel**. They had survived thirty-five dead and a basilisk. They were becoming a legend, but legends required monsters to lead them. She took the vial, drained it in one grimace-inducing swallow, and the transformation began.The mutation was violent. For the next day, HiYun set aside his scalpels and books to tend to her, watching as her body fought to integrate the unnatural resilience of the Unhold. Only when her fever broke on the afternoon of Day 36** did he return to his autopsy. From the remains of the necromancer's "specimens," he extracted a prize of biological horror: a large red worm**, thick and pulsing, a conduit of the dark arts that had animated the sand-dead.The Vizier’s IndifferenceBy the morning of Day 37**, the company returned to Ka-Sabar**. NeCola walked with a stiff, unnatural gait—the mutation was still knitting her flesh into something denser, something harder to kill.The reception at the palace of Yazid Al-Sabbag** was a carbon copy of their previous dismissal. The Vizier of Trade didn't even grant them the courtesy of his cushioned presence. A servant met them at the threshold, reciting the same scripted disdain as before."The Crownling is rewarded 2,290 crowns... dismissed... Leave."The heavy satchel of gold was dropped into HiYun’s hands. To the nobles of the south, the company was still just a tool—a blood-stained broom used to sweep away a necromancer and then hidden away in the closet. But they didn't see what HiYun saw: a company that had outgrown its "Crownling" status, led by a woman who was no longer entirely human.With the 2,290 crowns** added to their already overflowing coffers, the company turned their backs on the palace for the last time this week.Current Status:**NeCola:** Mutated (Unhold). Currently recovering (3-5 days).Inventory:** Large Red Worm (Alchemy Ingredient), massive gold reserves.Company Mood:** Exhausted but incredibly wealthy.The desert sun is high. With NeCola needing time to fully recover from her second mutation, and your pockets heavy with Vizier gold, would you like to rest in Ka-Sabar** and upgrade the company's equipment, or seek out a specialist** to identify the properties of that red worm?

Session 11 Wrap-Up: The Gilded and the GraveThe dunes of Ka-Sabar** have been bled dry—both of monsters and of coin. What began as a desperate trek from the frozen north has transformed the company into a wealthy, scarred, and increasingly supernatural force.The Ledger of the SandsThe Purge:** You successfully cleared the north of direwolves and the south of nomads, assassins, and the ancient, gold-clad Embalmed**.The Harvest:** Through blood and bartering, you’ve amassed a staggering fortune (nearly 10,000 crowns** this session alone).The Evolution:** * NeCola** has transcended her human limits, now hosting both a silver sword and the unnatural constitution of an Unhold**.Abel the Conjurer** has traded his physical mobility for eldritch momentum, a "stray arrow to the knee" only cementing his path as a master of the unseen.Sadiya** and Yared** have been forged in the crucible of a seventeen-round necromantic siege, proving they are far more than just "new recruits."Current Company StandingThe Viziers may look upon you with disgust, but they do so from behind locked doors, clutching their purses. You leave Ka-Sabar** with the Large Red Worm**—a trophy of high-level necromancy—and a roster of killers that the desert will not soon forget.Safe Haven Reached.** The company is currently resting in the shade of the Ka-Sabar markets as NeCola’s body finishes its violent integration of the Unhold mutagen.When we resume Session 12, would you like me to begin with the company’s departure from the city-states, or shall we start by spending some of that hard-earned gold on legendary-tier gear in the southern bazaars?**
