## Gemini

Welcome back to the campfire, Captain. The men are fed, the gear is mended, and the contracts are signed. Session 5** officially begins now.As your Game Master, I’m ready to weave your next moves into the grim, muddy reality of the world. I have the roster of your brothers and the current state of your company in mind. We’ll keep the pace tight and the steel sharp.The mercenary life waits for no one. Based on where we left off:Current Location:** Standing by for your confirmation.Active Objective:** Awaiting your next command or the details of the latest contract you’ve accepted.The Atmosphere:** The Abyssal Mage's influence looms, and the men are looking to you for orders.What is the company's first move for this session?**

It's Day 13 afternoon. We are in the middle of the desert heading to Ras Karim


---


## Gemini

The sun beats down relentlessly on the shifting sands. It’s the afternoon of Day 13**, and the heat is beginning to take its toll on the men. Water skins are feeling lighter with every mile, and the horizon shimmers with a deceptive haze.You are currently navigating the dunes, pushing toward Ras Karim**. The company is maintaining a steady pace, but the open desert is never truly empty.Status:** Traveling (Southern Deserts).Conditions:** High heat, clear visibility.Morale:** Steady, though the heat is testing their resolve.As the spires of the city-state begin to flicker in the distance, how do you want to proceed?Would you like me to describe any random events encountered on the road, or should we fast-forward until the company reaches the gates of Ras Karim?**

## User

Almost reaching Ras Karim by Day 14 morning. We encountered an event:  ---  You come across a line of men being marched in chains. Their leader remarks that they are a part of the 'indebted,' but one of the men, clearly a northerner, yells out that they're merchant mariners who have been captured by pirates. The supposed manhunter at the head of this troop laughs.  "Don't believe his lies, traveler, those who are deeply indebted to the Gilder fear the long journey to redemption. He'd rather die and face hellfire than trouble himself with salvation. Is there nothing more human than that?"  Bardol F the fisherman steps forward.  "Wait, I know this man! He's not indebted to no one, we used to sail together many winters ago."  The sailor nods.  "Yes, yes that's right!"  The manhunter looks over, then walks forward and frees the sailor.  "I am no stranger the circumstances and complexities of the Gilder and can see the machinations of his designs. No doubt he wanted these two to meet. Please, have the man, and his salvation shall be true."  The manhunter continues on with his train of captured men. One turns to you.  "Real shame we don't farkin' know each other, yeah?"  ---  Fisherman FRETHOLD joins the company. Another fodder to replenish the line!


---


## Gemini

The sun rises on Day 14**, casting long, golden shadows over the dunes as the white walls of Ras Karim** finally crest the horizon. The encounter with the manhunters leaves a strange taste in the air—a mix of southern "justice" and a stroke of pure Northern luck.Bardol F** claps the newcomer on the shoulder, hauling him toward the back of the line where the spare gear is kept. Frethold** looks ragged, his skin salt-crusted and sun-scorched, but he handles a rope like a man who knows his way around a deck. Another body for the meat grinder, or perhaps a hidden gem in the making.New Recruit: Frethold the Fisherman**Background:** Fisherman (Skilled with nets, decent fatigue).Role:** Frontline Fodder / Support.Current State:** Integration complete. He's hungry, but grateful to be out of chains.The gates of Ras Karim stand before you, guarded by Gilder-fearing soldiers in shimmering mail. The smell of spices, sweat, and opportunity wafts from the city markets.Shall we head straight to the Vizier's palace to look for work, or do you want to hit the market first to kit out Frethold?**

We struck gold at Ras Karim, sell prices are amazing... AND the arena is here. We have chosen the ambition to win 5 arena fights. This is when we begin. Our first fight is against 2 nomads for 1570 crowns. HiYun, NeCola and Bradol joins the fight. NeCola dispacted the nomads easily while Bradol competently held the line with all his fresh! The later is struck down again but who cares


---


## Gemini

The crowd in the Ras Karim Arena** is deafening, their roars echoing off the sandstone walls as the blood of the nomads soaks into the dirt. Session 5** is off to a lucrative, if brutal, start.NeCola** moved like a whirlwind, proving exactly why he’s on the payroll by dispatching the desert dwellers with cold efficiency. HiYun** held his own, but it was Bardol F** who truly lived the mercenary life today. He held the line with "fresh" enthusiasm—right up until he was smashed into the dirt. Again.The man is becoming a living legend for his ability to survive being "struck down."Arena Results: Match 1/5**Payout:** +1,570 Crowns (The purse is heavy!)Ambition Progress:** 1 / 5** victories secured.Casualties:** Bardol F** is down but not out (presumably surviving with another "permanent" injury to add to the collection).The gold from the sales and the arena has filled the company coffers significantly. The Gilder shines on the Abyssal Mage's men today.With Bardol F likely needing time to stitch his skin back together, do you want to wait for the next arena match tomorrow, or use your newfound wealth to browse the high-end southern armories?**


---


## User

Next fight! 3 serpants for 1500 crowns. Same crew, GO AGIAN! "Bardol, try not to survive this one yah?" I said as we entered the arena. It was a easy win again and Bardol, well, he survived...  3rd and final fight of the day is 3 nomads. Let's hope bardol die this time


---


## Gemini

The crowd is starting to recognize the "Indestructible Fisherman." They chant—some in mockery, some in awe—as your trio steps back onto the blood-stained sands.Match 2: The Serpent Pit**The serpents hissed and coiled, trying to drag your men into their deadly embrace, but NeCola** and HiYun** kept their footing. Despite your "encouragement" to find a quick exit to the afterlife, Bardol F** clung to life with the tenacity of a barnacle. The snakes were turned into boots, and another 1,500 crowns** went into the chest.Ambition Progress:** 2 / 5** victories.Match 3: The Grudge Match**Opponents:** 3 Nomads
The Lineup:** HiYun, NeCola, and the man who refuses to die, Bardol F.The sun is low, casting long shadows across the arena floor. Three desert warriors enter from the opposite gate, spinning their scimitars and adjusting their turbans. They look leaner and meaner than the first pair, hungry to reclaim the gold you've bled from their kin.The gate slams shut behind you. The betting pool is heavily skewed toward Bardol surviving yet again, much to your chagrin.The nomads charge! How does the fight play out—does Bardol finally earn his funeral, or does the Gilder have more suffering in store for him?**


---


## User

Can you believe it... Bardol survived again with a struck down. The raven god is being funny... Well Hiyun and Necola both get a level up from the 3 fights. thats good


---


## Gemini

The crowd is absolutely losing their minds! They’re throwing flowers and trash in equal measure at the man who simply refuses to stay in the ground. Bardol F** is dragged from the sand once more, bleeding, bruised, and probably missing another piece of himself, but still breathing. At this point, the Raven God isn't just being funny; He's treating Bardol like a personal sitcom.That concludes the day's bloody work. The purse is overflowing, and the core of your company is sharpening into something truly dangerous.Arena Standings**Ambition Progress:** 3 / 5** victories.Payouts:** You've banked a small fortune today.The Survivor:** Bardol F (Struck down, but still on the roster).The Level Ups**NeCola:** The MVP of the pits. His efficiency is becoming terrifying.HiYun:** Proving his worth as a reliable hand in the thick of it.The sun sets over Ras Karim, and the "Abyssal Mage" company is the talk of the bazaar. You have two matches left to fulfill your ambition, but the men need rest (and Bardol probably needs a priest or a carpenter).How are you allocating the level-up points for NeCola and HiYun, and do you want to spend some of that "gold mountain" on better gear before tomorrow's bouts?**

Coming out of the arean with loads of coins as payout, we walked towards the recruitment area. We picked up an idebted by the name of ABANOUB IBN MANSUR as i see his potential in becoming something slightly more than a fodder; also he is indebted so I dont have to pay salary hahahaha! His background:  Much of the southern city states float atop the expendable bodies of prisoners of war, criminals, and indebted, throngs of people who have slighted the Gilder or His followers and must 'earn' salvation through hard work. Abanoub is one such unfortunate soul. So great the religious transgressions of his predecessors, Abanoub was born into an indebted family, and it is uncertain how far back into his ancestry you must go before a truly free man would be found. You hope Abanoub could make a sound sellsword, but you have the feeling his primary allegiance is to that which any man wishes to taste: freedom.


---


## Gemini

A savvy acquisition! Abanoub Ibn Mansur** joins the ranks, carrying the weight of generations of debt on his shoulders. The "salary-free" life is the dream of every mercenary captain—though as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. Let’s hope his hunger for freedom translates into a sharp blade and a sturdy shield.With the arena winnings jingling in your chest and a new "intern" added to the roster, the company is growing.Company Roster Update**The Veterans:** NeCola & HiYun (Freshly leveled and battle-hardened).The Miracle:** Bardol F (A man held together by spite and scar tissue).The New Blood:** Frethold (Fisherman/Fodder).The Bound:** Abanoub (Indebted, currently dreaming of a life without chains).The desert air cools as evening falls over Ras Karim**. You have plenty of crowns, a growing squad, and two more arena fights needed to fulfill your ambition. However, the Indebted often come with little more than the rags on their backs.What's the plan for Abanoub? Are you kitting him out with some of that arena gold, or is he heading into the next fight with whatever he can scavenge from the armory floor?**


---


## User

The day is still early, and we have to wait another day until the arena have more fights for us. I decided to walk across to Makan Muqadas, the next and final city state in the desert


---


## Gemini

The trek from Ras Karim** to Makan Muqadas** is a shimmering slog through the deep sands. With your purses heavy from the arena and your new "unpaid intern" Abanoub** in tow, the company makes good time.By the afternoon of Day 14**, the holy city of Makan Muqadas appears like a mirage—white domes and towering minarets dedicated to the Gilder. Being the religious heart of the south, the markets here are often filled with incense, relics, and high-quality armaments for the gilded guards.Arrival: Makan Muqadas**Company Status:** High spirits (thanks to the gold), but the heat is draining.The Indebted:** Abanoub is keeping his head down, likely overwhelmed by the sights of the holy city he was born to serve in chains.Bardol F:** Still limping, still breathing, still defying the natural order of life and death.The sun begins to dip. You’ve reached the final bastion of the Southern Deserts.What is your business in the Holy City? Are we checking the Tavern for rumors of the Abyssal Mage, scouting the market for "holy" gear, or looking for a quick contract to pass the time until the Arena resets?**

## User

On our way to Makan Muqadas, two interesting group of sandbags caught my attention.  ## 1 hyena  time of the dance again. annnnd all of my fodders survived with struck down??? what the hell...  ## Necromancer company of 3  A Necromancer  A Fallen Hero  An Embalmed Slave  VICTORY  The enemy was destroyed in 7 rounds  Statistics Loot  | Character | Kills | Ranged Damage | XP | Health Lost |  |---|---|---|---|---|  | HIYUN | 1 | 0 | 226 | 0 |  | NECOLA THE VATT'GHERN | 1 | 594 | 157 | 0 |  | KAETHERLEN | 0 | 40 | 85 | 0 |  | WILFRIED B | 1 | 76 | 142 | 0 |  | ABANOUB E IBN MANSUR | 0 | 0 | 115 | 118 |  | DAUID | 0 | 0 | 0 | 128 |  | FRETHOLD THE SAILOR | 0 | 0 | 0 | 82 |  | BARDOL F | 0 | 0 | 0 | 104 |  | JAN F THE BRIGHT | 0 | 29 | 0 | 102 |  FRETHOLD BARDOL and JAN finally die permanantly!


---


## Gemini

The desert sands are finally drinking their fill. The journey to Makan Muqadas** turned into a brutal gauntlet, proving that while the Raven God has a sense of humor, his patience eventually runs out.Event 1: The Frenzied HyenaIt was a chaotic "dance" in the dunes. The beast lunged, snapped, and tore, leaving your frontline a mess of shredded leather and bloody sand. In an almost slapstick display of resilience, your entire fodder line was "struck down" yet again. The men are starting to look more like patchwork quilts than soldiers.Event 2: The Sands of UndeathThe true test came shortly after: a Necromancer** and his grim retinue.NeCola the Vatt'ghern** lived up to his title, raining down a staggering 594 damage** to keep the undead at bay, while HiYun** and Wilfried B** carved through the rot. Abanoub** took a horrific beating—118 health lost**—nearly joining his ancestors before he even drew his first paycheck-free breath.The Butcher's Bill:**
The "Immortals" have finally met their end. The cycle of survival and injury is over for the veterans of the gutter:Frethold the Sailor:** Drowned in sand instead of water. KIA.**Bardol F:** The man who cheated death a dozen times finally ran out of luck. The legend of the Unkillable Fisherman ends here. KIA.**Jan F the Bright:** His light has finally flickered out. KIA.**GM Note:** You’ve cleared the dead weight and kept the killers alive. With the Necromancer** defeated, you likely scavenged some dark artifacts or strange gear from his remains.You arrive at the gates of Makan Muqadas with a significantly lighter roster but a much higher average of talent.** How do you want to mark the passing of the "Thrice-Struck" Bardol F, and who among the survivors (like the battered Abanoub) are you looking to reinforce first?**

## User

Just outside of Makan Muqadas, we once again chance upon a group of ghostly figures chasing after a small scouting party from the city state. we joined A Conscript and An Indebted in the fight against A Wiederganger  An Ancient Auxiliary  An Icy Golem  A Possessed Bandit Raider  A Possessed Billman  ---  It was a clean victory for us despite NeCola taking some damage from the fight


---


## Gemini

The desert sands around Makan Muqadas** are thick with the restless dead, but the "Abyssal Mage" company is becoming a beacon of grim efficiency. Stepping in to assist the city-state's scouts was a masterstroke—not only for the loot but for the potential favor with the Gilder’s chosen.The battle was a strange menagerie of horrors. An Icy Golem** in the Southern heat is a rare, chilling sight, and the Possessed** foes suggest a dark influence is spreading fast. NeCola** took some hits—a reminder that even a Vatt'ghern isn't invincible—but the line held.Battle Report: The Gates of Makan Muqadas**The Allies:** 1 Conscript & 1 Indebted (Grateful to have survived the nightmare).The Slain:** A bizarre mix of ancient steel, possessed flesh, and frozen stone.Casualties:** None this time, though the armor took a beating.With the dust settling, you find yourselves at the very threshold of the Holy City. The scouts you saved are likely singing your praises (or at least looking at you with a newfound respect).Status Update:**NeCola:** Damaged but triumphant.Abanoub:** Still standing! He's seeing first-hand that being "Indebted" to you is a very violent path to freedom.Purse:** Growing heavy with loot and gratitude.You enter Makan Muqadas as heroes of the road. Would you like to check the temple to heal NeCola's wounds, head to the Alchemist to see if they can make sense of that Icy Golem's remains, or head straight to the Vizier to turn this rescue into a formal contract?**

Event  ---  The battle over, you look around at the destruction it had wrought. Jan F the Bright is on his back, staring blankly at the skies with glazed eyes. Other brothers litter the battleground. They are ill-shaped, ragged, fractured and fragmented and soon fermented. It is a collectively cruel end. And now the flies are gathering, dotting the dead like skittering moles. They copulate on cold skin with shameless abandon and set about burrowing the next brood in the still-warm gore.  Wilfried B walks up and asks what it is you wish to do with the bodies.  You take a look up at the skies. Crows and archcrows circle overhead. They squall and sqwuak and bicker amongst one another as they await your departure. Sheathing your sword, you nod at the battleground.  "Loot the bodies. Leave the dead to the birds."  ---


---


## Gemini

The desert sun is a harsh judge, and the verdict is final. As the flies begin their work on Jan F the Bright** and the others, the reality of the mercenary life settles over the survivors like a heavy shroud. There are no grand monuments here—only the profit pulled from the pockets of those who didn't make it.Wilfried B** moves with the hollow efficiency of a man who has done this before, stripping the blood-slicked leather and dented steel from his former brothers. The squawking of the crows above grows more frantic, a feathered audience waiting for the final act."Loot the bodies. Leave the dead to the birds."**The command is cold, but practical. The Abyssal Mage's goals require crowns and steel, not graves and sentiment.The Current State of the Company**The Roster:** Lean, mean, and significantly more veteran. The "dead weight" has been literally shed.The Morale:** Grim. The men are hardened by the loss, but they carry the equipment of their fallen comrades.The Loot:** You’ve scavenged what remained of the fodder's gear—perhaps a few extra shields or some worn gambesons to sell or repurpose.You turn your back on the feast of the crows and walk toward the shimmering gates of Makan Muqadas**. The scouts you saved watch you approach, perhaps unnerved by the cold-blooded pragmatism of their saviors.What is your first order upon entering the Holy City? We have armor to repair, a Vatt'ghern to heal, and a new recruit, Abanoub, who just learned exactly how his service might end.**

## User

We finally entered Makan Muqadas by Day 15 Mid-day. Let's call it a wrap for this session. Do up a session summary


---


## Gemini

The gates of Makan Muqadas** swing shut behind you, providing a temporary sanctuary from the heat and the horrors of the dunes. Session 5** ends with the company significantly wealthier, though the ranks have been thinned by the desert's unforgiving nature.Session 5 Summary: The Blood of Ras Karim**The Triumphs**Arena Domination:** You conquered three consecutive matches in Ras Karim, taking down Nomads and Serpents. Your ambition to win 5 arena fights stands at 3/5**.Financial Boom:** The combination of selling high in the South and the arena payouts has left your treasury overflowing with crowns.The "Unpaid" Acquisition:** Recruited Abanoub Ibn Mansur**, an Indebted soul who brings potential (and a $0 salary) to the front line.Road Victories:** Dispatched a Necromancer's retinue and a bizarre ghostly warband (including an Icy Golem) outside the holy city.The Butcher's Bill**The "Miracle of the Dunes" has ended. The Raven God finally collected his dues from the men who refused to stay down:Bardol F:** The indestructible fisherman finally fell.Jan F the Bright:** KIA.Frethold the Sailor:** KIA.The Command:** "Leave the dead to the birds."* The company moves on with a lean, veteran core and cold hearts.Current Company Status**Day:** 15, Mid-day.Location:** Makan Muqadas (The Holy City).Key Survivors:** NeCola the Vatt'ghern** (Level Up!), HiYun** (Level Up!), Wilfried B**, and the survivor Abanoub**.Objective:** Fulfill the final 2 arena wins and continue the search for the Abyssal Mage's influence.Next time you return, shall we start by spending those hard-earned crowns in the Holy City's markets, or shall we head straight to the tavern to see what contracts the Vizier has for the "Crow-Feeders"?**
