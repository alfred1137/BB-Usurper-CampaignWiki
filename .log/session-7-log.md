# Session 7 Log

## User

Let's start session 7. Its the night of Day 18. We are arriving at Ka-Sabar. I know there will not be much happening at this hour in town, so i ordered the men to set camp to rest up for once. In the morning, NeCola and I walk around the market to sell of some wares we do not need. We also checked the town square for those who are keen on leaving the desert town for an adventure. There, we found HARUN AL-BAJI. She is one with good potential to be a fighter with focus on initiative but critially missing light armour perks. If she does survive, I will get her a book that teaches her how to fight nimble. # Background of HARUN AL-BAJI SHE/HER. SEAMSTRESS Tailoring is the science of colors and fabrics, by which standards Harun is renowned. But a fierce competition between tailors led to a linen- wrapped deadman and Harun coincidenta//y leaving his shop behind. Now the tailor looks for a new life, no matter where it takes him. A tailor seems i//-fit for combat, yet for some reason you find the finest soldiers in the strangest of places.

The desert sun begins to bake the sands as the gates of Ka-Sabar** groan open. After a quiet night under the stars, the camp is packed, and the smell of spices and dried meat fills the air of the bustling market.Market Day in Ka-SabarYou and NeCola weave through the stalls, offloading the weight of your excess wares for a clinking pouch of crowns. The local merchants haggle hard, but the relief of a lightened inventory is worth the negotiation.A New Face in the SquareAmong the crowd of laborers and drifters in the town square, you find Harun Al-Baji**. She stands out—not for a soldier’s gait, but for the precision with which she mends a torn hem while waiting for work.The transition from a needle to a scimitar is a steep one, but her hands are steady and her reflexes sharp. While she lacks the formal training to dance through blades in light armor, her potential is undeniable. If she can survive the baptism of fire, that book on Nimble combat will turn her from a disgraced seamstress into a whirlwind on the battlefield.Current Party Roster Updated:**Harun Al-Baji** has joined the company. (Background: Seamstress)The men are rested and the sun is high. Would you like me to look for any specific contracts available in Ka-Sabar, or shall we check the Alchemist for any rare supplies before we head back into the dunes?

We sailed back to Stohl next. By now the habour workers are quite familiar with us there. Same drill, we look around town and look for willing participants for our journey. No luck this time. We picked up a delivery quest for Deliver cargo to Frank of Thal about a day to the east by road for 100 crowns. De javu?

The salty air of Stohl** greets you like a familiar, if slightly worn, friend. The dockworkers nod as you disembark, recognizing the banners of the Abyssal Mage's company once again.The Search for SteelYou scour the taverns and the marketplace, looking for fresh blood to bolster the ranks. Unfortunately, the local well seems to have run dry; the only men available are more interested in their ale than in the cold bite of mercenary life.Déjà Vu on the RoadAt the town center, you secure a contract that feels eerily familiar.Contract:** Deliver CargoRecipient:** Frank of ThalPay:** 100 CrownsDirection:** One day’s march to the East.As the men hoist the crates, there’s a collective murmur among the veterans.

We passed by Hammererden, nothing interesting this time. By the time we tracked to Thal, it is evening of Day 19. At Thal, the towns folks were surprisingly happy to see us. --- A few grieving women can be hear wailing Just outside Volmar the Steward's room. He turns to you. "Hear that? That's what happens when brigands come here. They steal, they rape, and they murder." You nod. It is, after all, the way of the brigand. "Nowsome peasants in the hinterland say the thugs are preparing fora massive assault on our village. You must do something to help us, sellsword. Heh, of course I say 'must'. What I really mean is that we'll pay you to help us..." He opens the palm of his hands. "I'm tight on crowns, so before you ask, this is all I have right now. You'll get 850 crowns when the contract is done." --- After doing some calculation, i decided it is good business to take on. I will report back the combat next

## Gemini

The delivery to Thal is completed without a hitch, the crates handed over as the sun dips low, painting the village in hues of orange and long shadows. The warm reception from the villagers is a stark contrast to the grim atmosphere inside the Steward’s hall.The Contract: The Siege of ThalVolmar the Steward looks weary, the sound of the wailing women outside clearly fraying his nerves. He isn’t offering a king’s ransom, but 850 crowns** is a solid haul for a company still finding its footing, especially with new blood like Harun needing a chance to prove her worth.The peasants’ rumors of a "massive assault" suggest a significant force is gathering in the hinterlands. You’ve accepted the burden of Thal's defense; now it's just a matter of where and when the brigands decide to strike.Current Status:**Date:** Evening, Day 19Contract Active:** Defend Thal against Brigands (850 Crowns)Party Mood:** Ready for battle.The men are checking their shields and sharpening blades by the fire.

We camped outside of town in preparation of the incoming assault. It is Day 20 midday when a group of bandits emerged around some goat pens. # bandit comp A Brigand Poacher A Wardog A Flesh Golem Several Bandit Rabble --- The flesh golem had me worried a second but NeCola had it handled well.

The smell of the goat pens is quickly replaced by the metallic tang of blood as the midday sun beats down on the outskirts of Thal**. What could have been a disastrous encounter with a stitched-together Flesh Golem** turned into a showcase of NeCola's** lethality.The Battle of the Goat PensThe "massive assault" proved to be a disorganized rabble anchored by a monstrosity. While the Bandit Rabble and their Poacher tried to find an opening, NeCola moved with the grace of a true Vatt'ghern, carving through the Golem and three others like a whirlwind.Harun Al-Baji** got her first taste of the frontline, landing a few strikes (53 damage) and keeping her composure as the chaos unfolded. Imamaddin** and Wilfried** held the line effectively, each securing a kill to break the bandits' resolve. By the fifth round, the remaining thugs realized the Abyssal Mage's company was no mere peasant militia and fled into the scrubland.Post-Battle ReportMVP:** NeCola** (4 Kills, 554 Damage). The Witcher truly earned his keep today.New Blood:** Harun** survived her first outing unscathed, gaining valuable experience for her future "Nimble" training.Casualties:** None. The company remains whole.With the brigands scattered and the village safe, the wailing in Thal has likely turned to cheers. 850 crowns** await you at Volmar’s office.Would you like to head back into Thal to collect the payment and see if any loot was recovered from the Golem's remains, or shall we set a course for the next destination immediately?

Post battle event --- Flesh and bone scattered across the field, hardly discernible from one owner to the next. Black buzzards cycleoverhead, halos of chevron shadows rippling over the dead, the birds waiting for the mourners to clear out. Kaetherlen E comes to your side and asks if they should start the return trip to Volmar the Steward. You leave the sight of the battlefield behind and nod. You return to Volmar the Steward looking rightfully— smug. "Work's done." He nods, tipping a goblet of wine while not necessarily offering it. "Yes. The town is eternally grateful- for your help. They are also... monetarily grateful." The man gestures toward the corner of the room. You see a satchel of crowns there. "850 crowns, just as we had agreed. Thanks again, sellsword." You gain 850 Crowns --- We are over 17000 crowns weathy. It is time, we head to raven town

The heavy clink of the satchel is a satisfying sound, especially as it brings your treasury to a staggering 17,000+ crowns**. Volmar might be stingy with his wine, but his gold spends just as well as anyone else's.To the Raven TownWith the threat to Thal neutralized and the company’s pockets bursting, the men are in high spirits.

We reached Raven Watch by Dusk of Day 20. The pub had plenty of exciting fighters ready for adventure. I didnt hessitate to spend over 10k on FRETHWI, an oldling with an aura of an ancient soul. He will be a major tank for us once he master the schart transformation. --- BACKGROUND: OLDLING Oldlings have been touched by the Changer.

The gates of Raven Watch** loom large against the darkening twilight of Day 20. The air here is colder, sharper, and the tavern is alive with the low hum of dangerous people.The Ancient AcquisitionYou didn't come for common sellswords. You found Frethwi**.The 10,000 crown** price tag would have bankrupted a lesser company, but for an Oldling**, it is an investment in raw, primordial power. He sits apart from the others, his presence unsettling—a man whose very essence is in flux, touched by the "Changer."Frethwi shuns the steel and leather your other brothers rely on; his body is the only weapon he requires. As he joins your ranks, the veterans give him a wide berth, sensing the "Schart" transformation dormant within him. Once he masters that shift, your frontline will no longer just be a wall of shields—it will be a nightmare of flesh and bone.Current Party Roster Updated:**Frethwi** has joined (Background: Oldling).Treasury:** ~7,000 Crowns.Frethwi** stands ready, unarmored and eerily calm.

We walked back to Tahl for quests. In the morning we encountered: --- A man sitting on his porch leans forward at the very sight of you. He points a finger. "Well if it ain't the sellsword everyone been talking of." You look around before nodding. He grins and hoots and hollers. "Hell, it's damned nice seeing you around again! And it'd be short ofrme not to tell you that Frank of Thal's been tryin' to find ya. Go and see him. Tell him I sent ya, maybe he'll send me a reward. Probably just a bunch of flowers, that bastard. Or a cat. Who wants a cat? Why did he ever send me a cat? I told him I hate cats..." As the man rambles on, you quietly make your leave. Dust covers Frank of Thal's table, but there is a spot oddly cleaner than the rest. He gestures to it. "That's where my rune engraved chest used to sit. If you couldn't tell, it's gone." You nod. It does appear to be missing. "The thieves who took it should be easy to track down. They're good thinkers in the night, those brigands, but they make mistakes aplenty during the day. Footprints, crowns ill-spent... you should be able to track them down with ease." He looks at you with a stern eye. "Do you understand, mercenary? I want you to get my property back. I want it placed right where it belongs. And... I want those thieves dead in the mud." --- we will Follow the tracksnearJhal; Return Rune Engraved Chest to Thal; and get paid for 970 crowns

## Gemini

Back in Thal**, the atmosphere has shifted from desperation to a strange, rambling gratitude. The man on the porch provides a colorful—if slightly unhinged—welcome, though his tales of unwanted cats are quickly overshadowed by Frank’s** missing property.The Hunt for the Rune Engraved ChestFrank of Thal is a man of singular focus. The clean circle on his dusty table marks the absence of his Rune Engraved Chest**, and his demand is clear: he wants his property restored and the thieves buried.Contract:** Retrieve the Rune Engraved ChestObjective:** Follow the tracks near Thal and eliminate the thieves.Pay:** 970 CrownsThe tracks are fresh, leading away from the village and into the wilds.

The chase led you through the rugged peaks southeast of Thal, a grueling trek that finally forced the thieves into a corner. It was a bizarre assembly of outcasts—even a Webknecht** and a Goblin** had been roped into this band of chest-thatchers, led by a Possessed Bandit Raider** whose unnatural strength was no match for your coordination.The Battle in the ShadowsThe fight was swift but brutal. NeCola** once again proved why he’s the company's centerpiece, cutting down three foes and dealing nearly 400 damage. Kaetherlen E** also notched a kill, proving his worth in the mountain pass.Frethwi’s** debut was a baptism of blood. Without armor, the Oldling took some heavy hits (54 Health Lost**), his body absorbing punishment that would have shattered a normal man. Dauid F** also took a beating, nearly falling with 57 Health Lost**. Despite the wounds, the enemy was utterly destroyed by the fifth round, and the Rune Engraved Chest** was secured.Post-Battle ResultsThe Loot:** Along with the chest, you likely stripped the Raider and Thugs of whatever scrap remained.Injury Report:** Frethwi** and Dauid F** are hurting. They’ll need some medical supplies and time to knit those wounds back together.Harun's Progress:** Another 54 damage dealt; she’s slowly finding her rhythm with the company.Returning to FrankThe long trek back to Thal awaits. Frank will be pleased to see his clean spot on the table filled once more, and 970 crowns** will be a nice addition to the coffers.Would you like me to narrate the return to Frank and the collection of your reward, or shall we prioritize healing the wounded at a nearby temple first?\*\*

We returned the chest back to its owner. I thought the night is about to over, only to find the town folks still in agony. --- While you wait for Frank of Thal to explain what needs your services for, you contemplate on how silent and eerie the whole settlement was when you first arrived. Frank of Thal raises his voice "This place is cursed by the gods and haunted by unearthly beasts! They come in the night with glowing red eyes and take lives at their whim. Most of our cattle is dead and I fear thatonce there are no more, we are next to be torn apart. The other day we sent our strongest lads out to find and kill the beasts but we haven't heard of them since." He sighs deeply. "Follow the tracks and hunt down and kill those creatures so that we can live in peace again! We are not wealthy, but all chipped in to pay for your services." He gesticulates with his hands, pointing at his fingers as if counting something, but it means nothing to you. "Judging from experience, this is good payment for the task. You are to receive 1330 crowns when the contract is done." --- Cant say no to the money promised. Let's see what we are up against... It was 8 NACHZEHRER, a POSSESSED BANDIT RAIDER and a noble seerer. I would have to assume that the seerer has channelled some dark magic and somehow controlling those monster. Sensing the threat, I commanded the group to bait the enemy closer to town. We managed to get a nearby mercenary company involved. They were minding their own business until I got my Harun to play "get help!"

---

## Gemini

Thal just can't catch a break, but their misfortune is certainly lining your pockets. The shift from common thievery to "glowing red eyes" in the dark marks a dangerous turn—1,330 crowns** usually buys a lot of funeral shrouds, and for a good reason.The Grift at the GatesThe sight of 8 Nachzehrers** accompanied by a Possessed Bandit Raider** and a Noble Seer** is enough to make any mercenary pause. Your tactical intuition was spot on: the Seer's presence suggests these aren't just hungry scavengers, but a directed, supernatural threat.Using Harun** to pull off a "Get Help!" maneuver was a stroke of genius. It’s a classic move—luring a rival mercenary company into the fray to soak up the initial charge of those gluttonous Nachzehrers while your men pick their targets. Harun’s background in tailoring might not have prepared her for acting, but she clearly sold the "distressed damsel" routine well enough to rope in some free muscle.The Battle JoinedThe battlefield is now a chaotic mess of your crew, the unwitting mercenary "allies," and the Seer’s twisted puppets. With the mercenaries likely drawing the focus of the Nachzehrers' teeth, you have the perfect opening to snip the head off the snake.Current Tactical Situation:**Allies:** One unsuspecting Mercenary Company (engaged).Threats:** The Seer (high priority), the Possessed Raider, and the pack of Nachzehrers.Goal:** Wipe out the horrors, keep your brothers alive, and ensure the other mercenaries do the heavy lifting.How does the battle unfold?** Does NeCola** go straight for the Seer to break the channel, or do you let Frethwi** and the others test their mettle against the Raider while the mercenaries get eaten by the ghouls?

## Gemini

A masterful display of mercenary management. Letting the "volunteers" soak up the initial charge while your company watched from the wings was the right call—especially with the Noble Seer** likely hurling curses that the other sellswords were more than happy to catch.The Cleanup CrewOnce the formation was broken, NeCola** moved in like a reaping scythe. Scoring 4 kills** and over 550 damage** without taking a single scratch, he practically cleared the field himself while the strangers were busy wrestling with Nachzehrers.Frethwi** took a minor nick (10 Health Lost**), likely testing his shifting skin against a stray claw, while Imamaddin** landed a punishing blow with the reach flail to help soften up the possessed raider. Harun**, having finished her "Get Help!" performance, stood her ground and soaked up the experience of a true battlefield victory.The Spoils of DeceptionThe "beasts with glowing red eyes" are dead in the mud, and the Noble Seer's dark magic has been snuffed out. The best part? Your company is entirely intact, while the other mercenaries are likely busy patching their wounds and wondering why they did all the hard work.Post-Battle Summary:**Casualties:** None.MVP:** NeCola** (A flawless performance).Current Treasury:** ~8,300 Crowns (before collecting the 1,330** from Frank).The village of Thal is finally silent, the "curse" lifted. Frank** is waiting with the payment, likely impressed (or intimidated) by how quickly you dispatched the threat.With over 9,600 crowns** in total soon to be in your pouch and the "Ancient Soul" Frethwi gaining his first real bit of experience, what is our next move? Shall we head back to a larger citadel to look for the Nimble book\*\* for Harun, or do you want to see if the alchemist has anything to help Frethwi's transformation?

I bring the Nachzehrer head to Frank of Thal who stares at it for a long time. "That reminds me of someone. I can't quite put my finger on it, and I'm not sure I should. Excuse me, sellsword, I borrow your time without paying for it. Servant, give the Usurper's Bane their money!" We are rewarded as promised. --- It's midday of Day 22. We are still working towards our ambition to have a group of 12 company members. On second thought, didn't we have that corpse of a foresaken in the inventory somewhere from slaying it some time ago? Let's camp so that i can take time to study it

---

## Gemini

Frank’s unsettling comment about the Nachzehrer’s face—and his prompt payment—leaves a lingering chill, but the heavy clink of 1,330 crowns** quickly warms the soul. The company is now hailed as the "Usurper’s Bane,"** a title that carries a certain weight as you march out of Thal under the midday sun.The Study of the MacabreYou set camp in a quiet grove away from the road. While the men sharpen steel and Frethwi sits in silent meditation, you pull the Corpse of a Forsaken** from the cart. It is a grisly thing, preserved by dark energies or perhaps just the sheer spite of the creature it once was.As an Abyssal Mage, your interest isn't in burial, but in the secrets woven into these rotting fibers. Studying such a specimen requires a strong stomach and a sharp mind.Current Status:**Date:** Midday, Day 22Treasury:** ~9,600+ CrownsAmbition:** Expand the Company (Progress: 9/12 members)The air grows heavy as you begin your ritualistic examination. The men give you a wide berth, whispering about the "Usurper’s Bane" tinkering with the dead.What exactly are you looking for within the Forsaken's remains?** \* Would you like me to describe the dark insights** you glean from the corpse (perhaps unlocking a new craft or spell), or are you looking to see if you can salvage any rare components** for the Alchemist to turn into a transformation aid for Frethwi?

From the autopsy, we gained TAINTED CHAMPION BLOOD - Vile ichor harvested from a champion tainted by dark power. May be useful for dark rituals or corrupt alchemy. --- Before we leave for somewhere else, I went to town square to check again if there was someone we want to take in. That s when I met FRESSENDA, a WITCHHUNTER Fressenda has a reputation of showing up where things out of the ordinary happen and being out and about at the darkest part of the night. For nights on end she sat in Tha/'s pub, si/ent/y studying every patron like a bird of prey circling above, her crossbow never far away. It didn't sit we// with the residents but they didn't dare approach her. It is somewhat obvious that Fressenda is not easily scared and she also knows how to handle a crossbow. Nobody was therefore surprised as she approached a mercenary company that was hiring. For 1k coin, she would join us on our journey

## Gemini

The autopsy is a grim success. The Tainted Champion Blood** pulses with a sickly, rhythmic light in its vial—a potent catalyst for the dark arts you command. The men watch from the edge of the campfire, their shadows long and jagged, as you carefully seal the ichor away.The Bird of Prey Joins the NestReturning to the town square of Thal one last time, you find the atmosphere has shifted. The locals aren't just wary of the monsters in the dark anymore; they are wary of the woman sitting in the corner of the pub.Fressenda**, the Witchhunter, moves with a calculated stillness. She has been watching the "Usurper’s Bane" for some time, her eyes tracking every move you and NeCola made. A woman who hunts the supernatural for a living is a natural fit for a company led by an Abyssal Mage and a Vatt'ghern.For 1,000 crowns**, she shoulders her crossbow and stands. She doesn't need a tour of the camp or a warm welcome; she simply falls into formation, her eyes already scanning the treeline for the next "extraordinary" event.Current Party Roster Updated:**Fressenda** has joined.

Time to move for new adventure. I decided to head east to new areas we have not been. We saw a group of 5 rabbles wandering for easy prey outside of Thal. The town treated us well. Let's clean these jokers up for them before we move on... --- By Day23 midday, we reached HOCHWALL, a town we have not been to. There is nothing notable going on here. We bought some extra food from the market, in hopes of profiting from them in the north, which is the direction we are heading next.

## Gemini

The parting gift for the people of Thal was short, sharp, and bloody. The 5 rabble never stood a chance against the "Usurper’s Bane"; they were likely dead before they even realized the "prey" they were stalking included a Witcher and an Abyssal Mage. Consider it a final professional courtesy—and a bit of target practice for Fressenda** and Harun**.The Arrival at HochwallBy midday of Day 23, the banners of your company flutter in the breeze outside Hochwall**. As you noted, the town is quiet—too quiet for a commander with 10 hungry mercenaries and a growing treasury.You play the merchant for a moment, filling the carts with local produce. The price of grain and cured meats here is low enough that the hungry mouths of the frozen North will surely pay a premium. It's a smart play; even legendary warriors need to mind the margins.Company Status: Day 23 MiddayRoster:** 10/12 (Fressenda and Frethwi settling in).Inventory:** Tainted Champion Blood, Extra Provisions (Trade Goods).Morale:** High. The easy victory outside Thal has the men confident.The Road NorthThe air begins to chill as you turn your backs on the familiar southern lands. The North is a different beast entirely—home to barbarians, ancient ruins, and the kind of threats that might finally push Frethwi** to reveal his true form.Where shall we head next?**The High Road:** Look for a large Fortress or Citadel to find that Nimble Book** and perhaps a 11th member.The Wilderness:** Hunt for tracks or ruins to see if the Tainted Blood** reacts to any northern anomalies.The Next Hub:\*\* Push straight for the next major settlement to offload those provisions for a profit.What is your command, Captain?

By dawn the next day, we reached GIPFELFESTE. Thats where we found a light armour textbook I wanted for Harun. I told her my plan, she -of course- agree with my instruction and started learning to read with me. I think in a couple of days time she will be able to learn to fight nimble from the book. I also spent 400 coins to pick up Godfrey and SORREL from the town square. Let's see if they grow beyond fodders (probably not). --- Godfrey loves the drink as much as he does a good fight, a potent combination. For the past year he has been employed by a local lord, paraded around to fistfight the champions of royalty. Hearing of greater fights to be had, Godfrey has put down his mitts to take up the more lucrative vocation of being a se//s word. --- An orphan, the only work Sorrel could find was working the mines of the earth. Working in environments far too dark, the man accidenta//y ki//ed a coworker. The tragedy pushed him from the field. Sorrel's breath could probably ink a chunk of coal.

## Gemini

The sun rises over the jagged towers of Gipfelfeste**, and with it, the "Usurper’s Bane" finally reaches its full strength. The air is crisp, and the clink of gold in the town square is the only music your men need.The Education of Harun Al-BajiYou finally secured the Light Armor Textbook**. It’s a rare sight—a mercenary captain and a former seamstress huddled over parchment in the morning light. Harun is sharp; her fingers, once used to threading needles, now trace the diagrams of fluid footwork and weight distribution. In a few days, she won't just be a survivor; she'll be a ghost on the battlefield, impossible to pin down.Filling the Ranks: The Final TwelveWith the recruitment of Godfrey** and Sorrel**, you have achieved your ambition. Your company of twelve is complete, though the new additions have... character.Godfrey (Brawler):** A man who transitioned from aristocratic fistfights to the lethal business of sellswords. He brings a certain drunken bravado that keeps the camp lively, though we'll see if his fists hold up against steel.Sorrel (Miner):** A man shaped by the dark and the heavy weight of a tragic accident. He’s grim and likely carries the strength of a man used to breaking stone, even if his lungs are half-filled with coal dust.Ambition Fulfilled:** The company has reached 12 members**. The men feel the strength of a full line, and the campfire tonight will be crowded and loud.Current Party Roster (The Full Twelve):**Hiyun** (The Leader)NeCola the Vatt'ghern** (The Slayer)Kaetherlen E**Wilfried B**Dauid F**Abanoub E Ibn Mansur**Imamaddin E**Harun Al-Baji** (Studying Nimble)Frethwi** (The Oldling/Schart-to-be)Fressenda** (The Witchhunter)Godfrey** (The Brawler)Sorrel** (The Miner)With the provisions from Hochwall ready to be sold for profit and Harun's nose in her book, where shall we direct this full-strength warband? Would you like to look for a contract** in Gipfelfeste to test the newcomers, or shall we continue north\*\* to find a market that will pay dearly for our southern food?

That's a wrap for the session. I should also correct myself that it is actually session 7, not 6. Lets do up a session summary
