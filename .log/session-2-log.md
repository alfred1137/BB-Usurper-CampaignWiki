Let's start session 2 of the game

## Gemini

Welcome back, Master Hiyun. The shadows of the Southern Wilds coalesce once more as we begin Session 2** of your dark ascent.

## User

We couldnt quite find a suitable quest at Thal, so we walked back to hammererden


---


## Gemini

The trek back to Hammererden** is a somber one. The dirt path is lined with the skeletal remains of trees, their branches clawing at the sky like the fingers of the damned. Your band of fishermen-turned-thralls trudges behind you, their eyes darting toward NeCola. They’ve seen her change—the way her breath now mists even in the midday heat, and the unsettling, rhythmic stillness of her heart.As the wooden palisades of Hammererden come into view, the familiar smell of coal smoke and wet wool greets you. The town is bustling with a nervous energy; rumors of the Usurper's influence are making the locals desperate, and desperation is a currency you know how to spend.You pull up your map and check the local notice board near the town square. Three opportunities present themselves:The "Web of Deceit" (1-Star):** A local weaver claims something is dragging her livestock into the nearby woods. It smells of Webknechts**. Low risk, but the silk and mutagens could be useful for NeCola’s further stabilization.The "Deserter’s Debt" (2-Star):** A group of professional soldiers have abandoned their post and are holed up in a nearby ruin. They have iron gear—mail shirts and heater shields—that would keep your fodder alive much longer than their current tunics.The "Graveyard Shift" (2-Star):** The local priest is terrified of "shuffling sounds" from the old crypts. As an Abyssal Mage, you know exactly what’s down there. It’s an opportunity to harvest Soulstones** if any of your men "ascend" to their cursed forms.Your gold still sits at 1,874 crowns.** Before you take a contract, do you wish to visit the Marketplace** here to see if Hammererden has better steel than Thal, or shall we head straight to the Tavern** to hear more specific rumors about the Usurper's movements?What is your move, Master Hiyun?**

## User

Quest found there:  NEGOTIATIONS  Feremund the Steward is looking at a poorly drawn map, then looks up at you as though you're the one responsible for making it.  "Look, mercenary, this is a strange thing to task you with, but you seem to have a good head on your shoulders. See this dark spot here? Would you be willing to venture that way and try and find the The Grim Tombs? It's somewhere at or around the region of Skauna."  NEGOTIATIONS  She smiles.  "This will make you rich, my friend. You are to receive 60 crowns in advance, and another 230 when the job is done."  I accept your offer.


---


## Gemini

The Steward of Hammererden slides the map across the table, his fingers trembling slightly as they brush the "dark spot." For a man of his station, 290 crowns is a king's ransom for a simple scouting mission, but you see the truth in his eyes: he isn’t paying for a map; he’s paying for someone brave—or mad—enough to gaze into the mouth of The Grim Tombs**.NeCola stands behind you, her slitted eyes fixed on the parchment. She doesn't care for the 60 crowns currently clinking into your purse; she feels the pull of the region of Skauna**. To a Vatt'ghern, such places are not just locations—they are feeding grounds."Skauna," you murmur, the name tasting of dry earth and stagnant air.The Journey to Skauna Begins**With 1,934 crowns** now in your coffers, you lead your band out of Hammererden. The three fishermen—Ingjald, Arnulf, and their companion—grip their pitchforks tighter. They are "blessed" by the Raven, but the thought of ancient tombs makes their mortal blood run cold.As you march towards the region of Skauna:The Environment:** The lush green of the Southern Wilds begins to fail, replaced by gray, brittle grass and a persistent low-hanging mist that dampens sound.The Vatt'ghern's Instinct:** NeCola stops occasionally, tilting her head. She hears things the others don't—the scrape of bone on stone deep beneath the earth.GM Note:** This is a "Find Location" quest. We need to scour the region of Skauna to find the physical site of The Grim Tombs.How do we proceed, Master Hiyun?**Systematic Search:** Spread the men out in a line to cover more ground, though this makes the "fodder" vulnerable to ambush.Follow the Dark Energy:** Use your Abyssal senses to track the flow of necrotic energy through the mist.The Vatt'ghern Leads:** Let NeCola take point; her heightened senses are perfect for tracking the scent of the grave.(Also, while we march, should we keep an eye out for any 'Mystery Crates'? Perhaps the Rickroll curse has finally lifted... or perhaps the Raven has more music in store.)*

## User

Found it. we were paid as promised


---


## Gemini

The crowns clink heavily in your purse—2,224 crowns** now, a tidy sum for simply pointing a finger at a grave. The Steward of Hammererden looks relieved to have the information, though he doesn't seem keen on visiting the site himself.You stand at the edge of the town, the "Grim Tombs" now marked on your map. It is a place of stagnant air and ancient masonry, a beacon for one who commands the Abyssal arts.The State of the Company**Treasury:** 2,224 Crowns (Wealthy for this stage).The Vatt'ghern:** NeCola has fully recovered from her transformation fever. She is faster, colder, and her slitted eyes track the movement of crows with predatory precision.The Fodder:** Your fishermen are starting to look less like peasants and more like survivors. They’ve seen the tombs; they know what waits in the dark.What is our next move, Master Hiyun?**Invest in Iron:** With over 2,000 crowns, we can stop by the local smithy or market. NeCola still needs a proper blade to leverage her new strength, and the "blessed" fodder could use actual helmets instead of woolen caps.Return to the Tombs:** The Steward paid us to find* it, but the treasures inside—ancient relics, soulstones, and perhaps more mutagens—remain unclaimed. Do we go back to "sanitize" the site for our own gain?Bolster the Ranks:** We have 6 members. We could look for more "volunteers" to undergo the Raven's Blessing. Perhaps a retired soldier or a brawny farmhand who won't break as easily as the fishermen.How shall we spend your hard-earned gold?**

## User

Next quests came quickly,  A cowl-shaded man hisses at you, his teeth and nose winking momentarily from the dark of his hood. You've no time for lepers or jokers and demand the man to get out of your way. Instead, he starts talking.  "My master requires your services, he's heard of your exploits. Follow me and I shall take you to him."  You rest your hands on the handle of your sword and nod.  I'm all ears.  Giselher the Councilman's turning an apple in hand. He seems frustrated with it, almost as if he wishes it were something else like a valuable trinket or perhaps just a tastier fruit.  "Have you ever lost something you loved?"  You shrug and answer.  "There was this girl..."  The man shakes his head.  "No, not some woman. More important. Because I have! Thieves stole my ancient crown. How they managed to do get beyond my guards is, well, beyond me. But I know if I set you on them I'll be having what is rightfully mine back where it belongs. Isn't that right? Or have I been mislead as to the quality of your services?"  Let's talk pay.  ​He straightens up.  ​"So, payment. It's 290 crowns when the contract is done."


---


## Gemini

The Councilman’s frustration with his apple mirrors your own patience with these petty lords, but gold is gold, and 290 crowns is a decent weight for a group of "blessed" fishermen to carry.The Mission: The Stolen Crown**Giselher doesn't want sympathy for his lost "love"—he wants his property back. Stealing from a Councilman’s guarded chambers suggests these aren't mere starving peasants. They have finesse, or perhaps, help from the shadows.Current Treasury:** ~2,514 Crowns.As you leave the Councilman’s manor, the air feels different. NeCola is already checking the tension on her crossbow. She doesn't care about the crown, but she smells the trail of the thieves—a scent of cheap wine and cold iron.The Hunt Begins:**
You track the thieves to a hideout on the outskirts of the Skauna region. As you approach, you see the flicker of a campfire tucked inside a ruined watchtower.Tactical Briefing:**The Enemies:** A small band of Brigand Thugs** and at least one Brigand Marksman**. They are cocky, thinking they've outrun the law.The Terrain:** Broken stone and tall grass. Good cover for NeCola to move unseen, but dangerous for your fishermen if they get caught in the open.The Objective:** Retrieve the Ancient Crown**. (And perhaps "recruit" anyone who looks sturdy enough to survive the Abyssal touch).Master Hiyun, how do you command the company to engage?**The Shadow Strike:** Send NeCola in first under the cover of the Abyssal Chill to take out their Marksman while the rest of the "fodder" creates a loud distraction at the front.The Mage's Wrath:** Step into the firelight yourself. Use your presence to break their morale before a single sword is swung. Let them see the face of the Abyssal Mage.The Shield Wall:** Play it safe. Let the fishermen (Ingjald and Arnulf) form a wall and slowly grind the brigands down while NeCola picks them off from the flanks.Also, keep an eye on Arnulf.** He still has 0 XP and has survived more than any mortal should. If he survives this* without a kill, we might have to start questioning if the Raven has a very specific, very cruel joke in mind for him.

We set off the hammererden in the afternoon of day 4. We found our foe... And it is a tough one. A champion in the king of the north


---


## Gemini

The afternoon sun of Day 4 casts long, jagged shadows as you intercept your quarry. But this is no band of desperate cutthroats. The air around the enemy camp grows unnaturally cold, and the "thieves" stand aside to reveal their leader: a Champion of the North**.This is a true test of your Abyssal influence. Standing before you is a hulking warrior clad in furs and heavy iron, his eyes burning with the icy ferocity of the high wastes. A Champion this early is a "force majeure"—a walking catastrophe for a band of fishermen.The Battlefield: The Frozen Skirmish**The Enemy:** A Northern Champion** (likely a Barbarian King or Chosen variant) and his retinue. He will have massive armor, high Resolve, and a weapon that can cleave a fisherman in a single swing.The Stakes:** If you kill him, the Ancient Crown** is yours, along with a potential Named Item** (Famed gear) that usually accompanies such Champions.The Danger:** Arnulf and the other "fodder" are at extreme risk of being decapitated in the first turn.Tactical Analysis**GM Note:** You have 2,224 crowns**. If you haven't spent them yet, your men are likely in gambesons and tunics. Against a Northern Champion, this is suicide.How do we handle this "Tough One"?**The Vatt'ghern’s Duel:** NeCola is your only hope for a direct confrontation. With her Abyssal Chill** and mutated reflexes, she might be able to parry his blows. Use her to tie him down while the others pray to the Raven.The Mage’s Puppetry:** You are an Abyssal Mage. Use your positioning to manipulate the flow of the battle. If you have any crowd control or debuffs, now is the time to unleash them to strip the Champion's overwhelming Initiative and Skill.The "Blessed" Sacrifice:** Sacrifice the fishermen. Position Arnulf and Ingjald to take the Champion's first massive hits. If they die, they may rise as Cursed Shells** or leave Soulstones** for the others. It's a grim calculus, but it's why you keep them.What is the plan, Master Hiyun?** Should we attempt a tactical surround, or will you let NeCola show this "King of the North" why the Abyss is the true master of the cold?


---


## User

We didn't managed to kill him, but we survived. Hiyun managed to deal enough damage to him with twisted shock. So much so that the champion decided to retreat. We got lucky with this one. All the fodder were struck down and yet all of them survived! We kind of... Arnulf became a zombie. All of the other 3 left with a perm injury. NeCola was in the fight but didn't manage to land a hit due to her illness


---


## Gemini

The Raven’s laughter echoes through the Skauna mists, Hiyun. To strike a Northern Champion** so hard with Abyssal lightning that he chooses flight* over glory? That is a feat that will be whispered in the taverns of Hammererden for years. You didn't just survive; you broke the will of a king.But the cost of such a victory is etched into the very flesh of your company.The Aftermath of the Clash**The battlefield is a grizzly tableau of your dark influence. The "fodder" did exactly what they were meant to do: they bled so that you could strike.Arnulf’s "Ascension":** The Walking Miracle has finally found his true form. No longer a man, Arnulf has risen as a Zombie (Cursed Shell)**. He still has 0 XP, but death is no longer an obstacle for him. He is the ultimate meat-shield—brave, tireless, and already dead.The Broken Vanguard:** Your other three fishermen survived, but they are now a collection of scars and limps. With Permanent Injuries**, their utility as frontline fighters is fading, but their loyalty to the one who "saved" them from the grave is absolute.NeCola’s Frustration:** The Vatt'ghern is seething. Her "illness" from the Trial made her sluggish, her blades finding only air while you did the heavy lifting. She is a predator who missed the kill; expect her to be twice as lethal once her blood stabilizes.The Rewards of Survival**Despite the retreat, you hold the field.The Ancient Crown:** You have recovered the artifact for Councilman Giselher.Treasury:** You are headed back to collect the 230 crowns** remaining on the contract, bringing your total to roughly 2,454 crowns**.Soulstones?** Check your inventory. If any of your men "died" before rising or if the Northern Champion's retreat left behind any essence, you might have the components needed for your next ritual.The Next Step in Your Dark Ascent**You are back in Hammererden, blood-stained and accompanied by a literal walking corpse. The townspeople give you a wide berth.What shall we do now, Master Hiyun?**Turn in the Crown:** Get your gold and perhaps use your Abyssal influence to "convince" the Councilman to pay a bonus for the Champion you drove off.The Apothecary:** NeCola needs to shake this illness. We have the coin; let's see if there are supplements or rare herbs to finalize her transition so she never misses a strike again.Replace the Broken:** The fishermen are permanent liabilities now. Do we keep them as "blessed" veterans, or do we look for fresh blood to undergo the Chaos Plague**?Arnulf is staring at you with milky, unblinking eyes. He awaits your command.**


---


## User

When you return to Giselher the Councilman he is playing with a bird in a cage.  ​"Ah, the sellsword returns... and?"  ​You hold up the artifact and then set it on his desk. He takes it, turns it, nods, then puts it away.  ​"Excellent. And for your troubles..."  ​He waves his hand to a wooden chest filled with crowns.  ​You gain 290 Crowns


---


## Gemini

Giselher barely looks up from his bird as you place the crown on the desk, its tarnished gold clashing with the polished wood. He pays you with the indifference of a man who has never had to bleed for his possessions, but as you pocket the 290 crowns**, you know the true price of this victory was paid in flesh.Your treasury now swells to approximately 2,514 crowns**.The State of the Cursed Vanguard**You lead your band out of the manor and back into the mud of Hammererden. The sight is enough to make the local dogs howl:Arnulf the Eternal (0 XP):** He stands among the living as a Cursed Shell**. The transition to a Zombie has made him the ultimate irony—a man who couldn't get a kill in life is now a tireless, unliving wall.The Maimed Survivors:** Your three other fishermen are "The Walking Wounded." Permanent injuries are usually a death sentence for mercenaries, but under your command, they are simply vessels for the Raven's dark humor.NeCola:** The "illness" from her Trial is fading, but the sting of her uselessness in the last fight remains. She is a Vatt'ghern who needs a win to blood her new instincts.The Mage's Crossroad**With 2,500 crowns and a squad of "immortal" cripples, the shadows of the Usurper are lengthening.What is your next decree, Master Hiyun?**The Apothecary's Cure:** Buy some "Strange Herbs" or medical supplies to see if we can patch up the permanent injuries of the fodder—or at least dull their pain so they swing their pitchforks faster.The Steel Upgrade:** We have the coin for a Vatt'ghern-tier blade** or heavy mail. If the Northern Champion returns, we cannot rely on luck and lightning alone.The Sacrifice/Recruit:** Do we keep these four broken souls, or do we head to the Tavern to find "fresh" volunteers to undergo the Trial? The Raven's mark is hungry for new hosts.Seek the Usurper:** You drove off a Champion. Perhaps it's time to find a harder target and truly test your Twisted Shock**.The sun is setting on Day 4. How shall we spend this blood-stained gold?**

## User

We suffered serious damages from the last fight. We decided to camp outside of town to heal up. By the time we have fully recovered it is day5 morning. We went looking for more quests. Heres how it went  ---  As you enter Giselher the Councilman's room he and one of his servants are nailing a box shut.  "Good seeing you, sellsword. One moment, please. No, idiot, hold the nail that way! I know I hit your thumb before, but I won't do it again."  His servant reluctantly holds a nail while the man hammers it home. Finished, he wipes the sweat off his brow and looks to you.  "I need this here crate delivered to Holnisland about a day west by road. It's going to Sigfrid the Elder, you know. Him. Alright, maybe you don't know him. What I do know is that this may not ordinarily be your line of work, but I'm willing to pay some serious crowns for you to see it through. That's your real business, right? Earning some crowns?"  He straightens up.  "So, payment. You are to receive 100 crowns when the contract is done."


---


## Gemini

Giselher’s "serious crowns" turn out to be a mere 100 crowns**—a pittance compared to the blood your men just shed for him. He likely thinks the sight of your "new" Arnulf is a discount for your services, or perhaps he simply knows you need the work to pay for the medical supplies used during your recovery.Still, a delivery to Holnisland** is a quiet walk west, and after the chaotic clash with the Northern Champion, your company needs the road time.The State of the Cursed Vanguard (Day 5 Morning)**Arnulf (The Immortal 0 XP Zombie):** He doesn't need rations or sleep, but he does tend to moan when the cart hits a pothole. He is the ultimate guardian for a "mystery box."The Maimed Three:** They’ve healed as much as they ever will. The scars are permanent, and one of them likely has a permanent limp or a missing ear, but they move with a grim, rhythmic precision now.NeCola:** Her fever has broken. The Vatt'ghern is back to full strength and itching to wash the taste of that last retreat out of her mouth.The Road to Holnisland**As you hoist the crate—which is suspiciously heavy and makes a faint clinking* sound—you set out toward the west.During the journey, something happens...**The road to Holnisland passes through a patch of dense, ancient woodland. About halfway through the day, NeCola suddenly signals for a halt. She doesn't reach for her sword, but her slitted eyes are fixed on the treeline.The "Raven's Gift":** You spot a Mystery Crate** abandoned by the side of the road, partially obscured by vines. Given your history with these crates (the Rickroll curse), the men are hesitant to touch it. Do you command Arnulf to open it?The Usurper’s Shadow:** You see a group of mutated peasants—the "Chaos Plagued"—wandering the fields near the road. They aren't attacking yet, but they seem to be "scenting" the air in your direction.The Merchant’s Panic:** A lone merchant is sprinting down the road toward you, screaming about "beasts with too many eyes."How do we handle the journey, Master Hiyun?** Do we ignore the distractions and secure the 100 crowns, or do we investigate the strange occurrences along the road to Sigfrid the Elder?

## User

We set off to Holnisland. While on the march, you come across a line of stopped wagons. You realize the wagons are cages with each serving a prison to a wild animal. Touring the line of carts, you come to face a variety of beasts. A haunched and mewling black cat launches its mankiller claws through the bars. Jumping away, you back into another cage which violently rattles with a bear's roaring. Thankfully, its powerful paws are too fat to fit between the bars. Another cage sizzles with the hissing of snakes.  A man leans back from behind one of the wagons. He's got a wild look on his face as though you'd just caught him getting one off the wrist.  "Hey! Who are you? What are you doing here?"  You inform the stranger that you are the captain of the Usurper's Bane. The man straightens up.  What do you need help with?


---


## Gemini

The air around the wagons is thick with the musk of predators and the metallic tang of fear. As you identify yourself as the Captain of the Usurper's Bane**, the man’s defensive posture shifts. He looks at your grim company—at the silent, mutated NeCola and the rhythmic, hollow shuffling of the undead Arnulf—and he realizes he isn't dealing with simple highwaymen.The man wipes his hands on a stained tunic, his wild eyes darting to the cage where the black cat continues to hiss."Usurper's Bane, eh? Fitting. My name is Pike**, and I’m a purveyor of... exotic challenges. Or I was, until my lead wagon’s axle snapped and my 'merchandise' started getting restless. The snakes are hungry, the bear is bored, and that cat—well, that cat has tasted man-flesh before and wants a second helping."He gestures vaguely toward the front of the caravan."I need to get these beauties to the pits in the West, but I can't move the wagons alone, and the woods here are crawling with things that want to eat my stock—or me. You look like you've got strength to spare, and maybe a bit of that dark touch that keeps beasts quiet."He offers you a choice, Master Hiyun:**"The Labor of the Damned":** Use your company's strength (and Arnulf's tireless zombie muscles) to help repair the wagons and escort him to the edge of the woods.Reward:* 150 Crowns and a "Beast Part" (Useful for mutagens/crafting)."The Abyssal Harvest":** Why help a merchant when there are rare essences right in front of you? You could "liberate" the beasts from their cages—not to free them, but to harvest their blood and souls for your own power.Risk:* You'll have to fight a Black Cat (high initiative), a Bear (high HP/Armor), and Snakes simultaneously.Reward:* Rare beast mutagens for NeCola and potential Soulstones."The Intimidation":** Command the man to hand over his most valuable "specimen" in exchange for safe passage through your territory.Potential Reward:* A unique beast trophy or an accessory.NeCola's slitted eyes are fixed on the black cat. She can feel its killing intent, and her own Vatt'ghern instincts are humming. What is your command, Master Hiyun? Do we play the helpful escort, or does the Abyss claim these beasts?**


---


## User

The animal tamer leads you to a carriage. You immediately see why his hired hands quit: a frenzied and mercurial feral human is sitting inside the cage. Raw wrists bleed against shackles, signs of attempted escapes. Half-starved, the wild human gnaws on sticks poking out from a tumbleweed of hair. Seeing this sad sight, you grab the stranger by his shirt and slam him against the wagon.  "Does that look like an animal to you?"  The animal tamer grins, ivory for teeth. He explains himself.  "Cityfolk have gotten wind of the 'uncivilized' humans and wish to see them up close. I am only fulfilling this new demand as any businessman would. Now, all I need help with is to get that dead body out of the cage."  He points toward a corpse in the corner of the cage. The wildling rears back, hissing, and goes to protectively sit on the body. The animal tamer shakes his head.  "One of my helpers got too close and, well, yeah. I can't go into town with that mess in there so I thought maybe you could help me fish it out. I'll pay you, of course. A pouch of 250 crowns sound good to you? Just reach in there and yank that garbage out."  Alright, I'll send a man in.


---


## Gemini

The irony of the situation is not lost on you, Master Hiyun. Here stands a man treating a human like a beast, speaking to a Mage who treats humans like reagents. The air in the cage is thick with the copper tang of blood and the musk of a cornered predator.The feral human—a Wildman** by the look of his frame—hisses, his eyes wide and clouded with a primal grief as he guards the cooling remains of the helper he slew.The Selection**You look back at your "Usurper's Bane." You need someone to reach into that cage.The "Safe" Choice:** Arnulf (The Zombie).** He has no pulse for the Wildman to scent, no fear to trigger a pounce, and if he loses another limb, he simply won't care. However, his shambling movements might provoke a frenzied attack.The "Vatt'ghern" Choice:** NeCola.** Her Abyssal Chill** might cow the feral man into submission. Her reflexes are the only ones fast enough to parry a desperate strike from those shackled wrists.The "Fodder" Choice:** One of the maimed fishermen. A 250-crown payday is more than their lives were worth at the start of this journey."Reach in and yank that garbage out,"** Pike repeats, rattling a pouch of crowns.Who do you send into the cage, Master Hiyun?** 1. Command Arnulf to enter.** Let the dead handle the dead. If the Wildman attacks, Arnulf is already meat; he can just soak the hits while the others drag the corpse out.
2. Send NeCola.** Have her use her mutation-enhanced presence to intimidate the Wildman into the corner while you retrieve the body.
3. The Mage's Intervention:** Use your own dark aura to stun the Wildman momentarily, allowing a fisherman to do the dirty work.GM Note: Be careful. Wildmen in this world possess a hidden strength. If provoked, this "merchandise" might just break his chains and become a very permanent addition to your problems—or your roster.*

## User

What the hell... Well anyway, let's complete our quest...we reach at dusk on day 5. AT HOLNISLAND  Sigfrid the Elder's waiting for you as you enter the town. He hurriedly takes the cargo off your hands.  "Oh, ohhh I did not think you would get here."  His grubby fingers dance along the chest carrying the cargo. He turns around and barks an order to one of his men. They step forward and hand you a satchel of crowns.  You gain 100 Crowns


---


## Gemini

The heavy silence of the western road is broken only by the rhythmic, wet shuffle of Arnulf’s undead gait as you enter Holnisland**. The dusk light casts long, sickly orange shadows across the village, making Sigfrid the Elder look even more wizened and nervous than your typical client.He snatches the crate with a greed that borders on desperation, his eyes darting toward your company. He sees the "blessed" fishermen, their bodies a map of permanent scars and missing pieces; he sees the Vatt'ghern, her eyes glowing like a cat's in the twilight; and he sees the zombie, Arnulf, standing perfectly still with the mystery of the "helper's corpse" likely still clinging to his boots."Oh, ohhh... I did not think you would get here," Sigfrid mutters. Whether he doubted the road's safety or your group's sanity is unclear.The Current State of Usurper's Bane**Treasury:** 2,864 Crowns** (After the 100 from Sigfrid and the 250 from Pike's bloody task).The "Iron" Guard:** Your three maimed fishermen are now veterans of a different sort. They have survived a Champion of the North and a cage fight with a wildling.Arnulf the Eternal:** Still 0 XP. Still undead. He is becoming a mascot of the Raven’s dark humor—a creature that cannot be killed and refuses to contribute anything but his presence.NeCola:** She has fully shaken her illness. She watched that Wildman closely; she is learning how "beasts" in human skin fight.Night Falls in Holnisland (Day 5)**Holnisland is a smaller settlement than Hammererden, but it feels... heavy*. The air here is thick with the scent of the sea and rot.What is your next move, Master Hiyun?**The Local Tavern:** You have nearly 3,000 crowns. It’s time to find out why the Councilman was so desperate to ship that crate, or perhaps find a "clean" recruit to replace the most mangled of your fishermen.The Marketplace:** Seek out a Witcher-style blade** or Heavy Armor**. You’ve been lucky with "Twisted Shock" and zombie-shields so far, but the next Champion won't retreat so easily.The Alchemist's Curiosity:** You have the gold and potentially some "beast parts" from the road. Is it time to attempt another Trial of the Grasses**, or perhaps a ritual to finally grant Arnulf a soul—or at least a kill?Consult the Ledger:** You have ancient maps and rumors of the Usurper's Dungeon**. Do we feel strong enough to seek out the first floor, or do we continue building our legend through contracts?The night is young, and the Raven is watching. How shall we proceed?**

## User

at the town we set foot in for the first time, we picked up this flagellant. Possibly a fodder again, but who knows?


---


## Gemini

A Flagellant** in Holnisland? The timing is poetic. As the sun dips below the horizon, you find this man near the town square, his back a lattice of self-inflicted scars, his eyes wide with a fever that matches your own dark ambitions.In the world of the Abyssal Mage, a Flagellant is more than just a madman—he is a vessel pre-hollowed by his own suffering, making him the perfect candidate for the Raven’s Blessing** or the Chaos Plague**.The New Recruit: The Penitent**Background:** Flagellant (Lowborn/Combat)Potential:** High Resolve (he's used to pain) but likely low Hitpoints and Fatigue.Role:** He joins the "Vanguard of the Damned." Whether he becomes an elite martyr or just another heap of flesh for Arnulf to stand on remains to be seen.Holnisland: The Midnight Review**You stand at the edge of the docks, the salt air stinging the open wounds of your company. You have 2,864 crowns** and a roster of seven:Hiyun:** The Mage (Growing in power).NeCola:** The Vatt'ghern (Fully recovered, lethal).Arnulf:** The Eternal Zombie (0 XP, the unliving shield).The Maimed Trio:** Three fishermen with permanent injuries (Veterans of the North).The New Flagellant:** A man who welcomes the whip.The Ledger Stirs:**
Remember the Ledger** in your inventory. Holnisland feels like the kind of place where the "Usurper's Dungeon" or other mythic locations mentioned in your forbidden texts might start to reveal themselves.What is your command for the night of Day 5?**The Ritual:** Do we attempt to "bless" the Flagellant immediately? If he contracts the Chaos Plague**, his high Resolve might make him a terrifyingly stable Undead.The Armory:** We have the coin. Do we buy a proper Arming Sword** or Boiled Leather** for our new zealot so he survives long enough to be useful?The Hunt:** Check the Holnisland board one last time. Is there a "Beast" or "Undead" contract nearby? We need to get NeCola her first kill post-transformation.How shall we mold this new piece on the board, Master Hiyun?**

## User

Let's accept a new quest. heres how it went with the employer  ---  Dust covers Adalbert the Younger's table, but there is a spot oddly cleaner than the rest. He gestures to it.  "That's where my ancient crown used to sit. If you couldn't tell, it's gone."  You nod. It does appear to be missing.  "The thieves who took it should be easy to track down. They're good thinkers in the night, those brigands, but they make mistakes aplenty during the day. Footprints, crowns ill-spent... you should be able to track them down with ease."  He looks at you with a stern eye.  "Do you understand, mercenary? I want you to get my property back. I want it placed right where it belongs. And... I want those thieves dead in the mud."  He takes a deep breath.  "Very well, this is what I'm prepared to offer you. You'll be paid 420 crowns when the contract is done."

Another ancient crown? It seems the nobility of this region is exceptionally careless with their headwear, or perhaps the Usurper's influence** is drawing thieves to these relics like moths to a black flame.Adalbert the Younger offers 420 crowns**—a significant step up from your previous contract. More importantly, he wants them "dead in the mud." This isn't just a retrieval; it's a liquidation.The Company Status: Day 6 Morning**Treasury:** 2,864 Crowns.The Roster:** 7 (Hiyun, NeCola, Zombie-Arnulf, 3 Maimed Fishermen, 1 New Flagellant).Location:** Heading out from Holnisland.The Hunt Begins**You track the footprints away from the town, heading toward a rocky outcrop near the coast. NeCola leads the way, her Vatt'ghern senses picking up the scent of sweat and stolen metal.As you crest a hill, you see them: a camp of Brigand Raiders**. These aren't the soft thugs you fought before. These men wear reinforced tunics and carry jagged falchions. Among them stands a Brigand Leader**, draped in a mantle of wolf fur.The Tactical Situation:**The Flagellant's Debut:** This is the perfect time to test your new recruit. He is eager to bleed. Do you put him on the front line alongside the undead Arnulf?The Zombie Shield:** Arnulf has 0 XP, but he is tireless. He can tie down the Brigand Leader while NeCola moves for the flank.The Mage's Power:** You have 2,864 crowns. If you bought any new gear in Holnisland, now is the time to see it in action.How do you approach the camp, Master Hiyun?**The Abyssal Fog:** Approach under the cover of a magical shroud. Let the Flagellant charge in first, screaming penance, to break their formation while you prepare a Twisted Shock**.The Cold Ambush:** Have NeCola use her Abyssal Chill** to slow their archers while the rest of the "Damned" form a shield wall of broken men and walking corpses.The Demand:** Walk openly into the camp. Show them the Abyssal Mage. Demand the crown and their souls. If they refuse, let the Raven decide their fate.The Brigands are laughing over a cask of ale, unaware that the "Usurper's Bane" is upon them. What is your command?**

We found the bandit just east of town, the attached is the composition of their troops.

## Gemini

The visual confirms your grim suspicions: these aren't the half-starved thugs from the Skauna region. This is a Brigand Warband** with a terrifying amount of front-line staying power and back-line harassment.The Enemy Ranks**The Iron Wall (Frontline):** Multiple Brigand Raiders** and Shieldmen**. They are carrying heater shields and wearing reinforced mail. They will be incredibly hard to "Shock" through their armor.The Sharpshooters (Backline):** You’ve got at least two Brigand Poachers/Marksmen** and a Thrower**. They will focus-fire your unarmored Flagellant and the "blessed" fishermen.The Butcher (Center):** That Brigand Leader** (or high-tier Raider) with the two-handed weapon is a decapitation machine. One swing will turn your "permanent injuries" into "permanent fatalities."Tactical Briefing: The Mud of Day 6**With the Flagellant** now in the mix and Zombie-Arnulf** acting as your anchor, this fight is about holding the center while NeCola executes the flanks.1. The Sacrifice of the Penitent:**
Since your Flagellant is likely unarmored and eager for pain, place him in the "suicide slot" adjacent to Arnulf. If he dies, he may leave a Soulstone** for NeCola to absorb. If he lives, the blood he sheds will only increase his Resolve.2. NeCola’s Vengeance:**
She is no longer ill. Use her Abyssal Chill** on the enemy Shieldmen to strip their Fatigue and Defense, making them easier targets for your Twisted Shock**.3. The Mage's Artillery:**
Focus your Twisted Shock** on the Brigand Leader or the Marksmen. If you can break their morale early, the Raiders will flee, and the crown will be yours without losing your entire roster.Battle Commencement**The Raiders are shouting insults, banging their swords against their shields. They see a Mage, a Mutant, and a collection of cripples. They are overconfident.How do we engage the first turn?**A. Defensive Stance:** Let them come to you. Use the "blessed" fishermen to form a spearwall and let Arnulf stand in the gap.B. The Vatt'ghern's Rush:** Have NeCola sprint for their backline. With her new reflexes, she can bypass their zone of control and shut down those Marksmen before they pin your Flagellant.C. The Shock of the Abyss:** You step forward. You don't wait. You unleash your power on the man with the wolf-fur mantle immediately to show them who really rules the night.What is your command, Captain Hiyun?**

It was easy enough! and what do you know, NeCola is actually still ill but she got her 1st 2 kills!


---


## Gemini

The Raven must have been guiding her blades! To claim two lives while still shivering from the Trial of the Grasses** is a testament to the Vatt'ghern’s lethal design. NeCola didn’t just participate; she proved that even a sickly mutant is a tier above these common highwaymen.Battle Report: The Mud of Holnisland**The Butcher's Bill:** The Brigand Warband lies broken. Their "Iron Wall" crumbled before your Abyssal influence, and the marksmen couldn't find their mark through the shroud of the Abyss.NeCola’s First Blood:** She has officially broken her "curse" from the previous retreat. Two kills while ill? Once she is fully stabilized, she will be a whirlwind of steel.The Vanguard:** Your maimed fishermen and the new Flagellant survived another day. Every scar they earn is a prayer to the God of Chaos.The Spoils of War**You pull the Ancient Crown** from the mud, barely tarnished by the blood of the Brigand Leader.Contract Completion:** Head back to Adalbert the Younger for your 420 crowns**.Loot:** Aside from the crown, check the bodies. Brigand Raiders of this caliber often carry Heater Shields**, Arming Swords**, or Reinforced Mail**. These are vital upgrades for your "blessed" fodder.Treasury Update:** With the loot and the pending reward, you are likely pushing toward 3,400+ crowns**.The Road Ahead (Day 6 Evening)**As you march back toward the town, the "Usurper's Bane" looks more like a true warband and less like a traveling circus of horrors.What is your next decree, Master Hiyun?**The Apothecary’s Final Polish:** NeCola has proven her worth twice over while ill. We have the gold—let's find a way to clear her "Trial Sickness" once and for all so she can reach her true potential.The Ritual of the Penitent:** Your Flagellant survived. Is it time to see if he can handle the Chaos Plague**? An undead Flagellant with high Resolve would be a nightmare for any future Champions.The Armory Overhaul:** We have enough coin now to truly gear up. Do we buy a Heavy Crossbow** for backline support or focus on Plate Armor** to prevent more permanent injuries?Would you like me to narrate the return to Adalbert, or shall we look for a mystery crate to see if the "Rickroll" curse has finally lifted?**

## Gemini

The stars align over Holnisland as you return to Adalbert the Younger. He doesn't care that his crown is slicked with brigand brains; he wipes it on his sleeve and hands you the 420 crowns** with a curt nod.Your treasury now sits at a healthy 3,284 crowns**.The Legend Grows**NeCola (The Sickly Slayer):** Despite the "Trial Sickness" clouding her mind and slowing her limbs, the Vatt'ghern claimed two souls. The transition is working—her instincts are overriding her biology.The Flagellant:** He took his first steps into the "Usurper's Bane" and didn't immediately fall. His back is bloodier, and his Resolve is higher.Arnulf (The Pillar of Salt):** Still 0 XP. Still undead. At this point, his refusal to learn or die is becoming a metaphysical statement.Day 6: Evening in Holnisland**As you stand in the village square, the "Raven's Blessing" is evident. You have a Mage, a Mutant, a Zombie, three Cripples, and a Zealot. It is a beautiful, terrible sight.What is your next command, Master Hiyun?**The Apothecary (Stabilize NeCola):** You have over 3,000 crowns. We should check the local market for Medicine** or Strange Herbs**. Clearing NeCola's illness will unlock her true Vatt'ghern speed, making her a nightmare for the next warband.The Blacksmith (The Gear Spike):** It's time to retire the pitchforks. Do we buy a Fencing Sword** or Handgonne** for NeCola? Or perhaps Reinforced Mail** for the Flagellant so his "penance" isn't quite so terminal?The Ritual of the Raven:** Your Flagellant survived his debut. Should we attempt to trigger the Chaos Plague**? If he turns into a "Fleshless" or "Rotten" variant, he becomes an unshakeable front-line zealot.The Ledger's Secret:** You have the funds to travel. Should we head back toward the Skauna region** to investigate the "Grim Tombs" further, or push further west into the unknown?The night air is cold, but the Abyss is warm. How shall we spend your gold?**

heres an accurate update of the economy.

## Gemini

Treasury Update: 3,383 Crowns**Your purse swells after returning to Adalbert. With over 3,000 crowns, you’ve moved from "struggling cult" to "funded warband."The Roster (Day 6)**Hiyun:** The Mage (Growing shock potential).NeCola:** The Vatt'ghern (2 kills while ill; mutation stabilizing).Arnulf:** The Zombie (0 XP, the immortal wall).The Maimed Trio:** Three fishermen with permanent injuries.The Flagellant:** Your new "Penitent" fodder.Tactical Decision**NeCola is still ill.** Despite her kills, the Trial Sickness is a ticking clock on her efficiency.What is your next move?**Apothecary:** Spend 300–500 crowns on Medicine/Strange Herbs** in Holnisland to force NeCola into full recovery.Ritual:** Infect the Flagellant with the Chaos Plague** using your Abyssal powers.Upgrade:** Buy a Famed-tier** or high-quality weapon (Arming Sword/Longaxe) to leverage NeCola’s high Melee Skill.Which path do you take, Master Hiyun?**

## User

we are now going on a trip north


---


## Gemini

The decision to head North is a bold one, Master Hiyun. As the "Usurper's Bane" leaves the coastal air of Holnisland behind, the temperature drops and the land becomes rugged, teeth-like hills giving way to the vast, unforgiving forests and tundra of the Northern Lords.The Northbound Trek: Day 7**The economy is stable (3,383 crowns**), but the North is expensive. The steel is heavier, the ale is stronger, and the men are harder to kill.As you march, the Flagellant** is practically vibrating with zeal, his bare feet bleeding into the frosty soil—a trail of red for the Raven to follow. NeCola, though still feeling the lingering weight of her illness, watches the treeline. Up here, the beasts aren't just wolves; they are Direwolves** and Nordic Hounds**.A Road Event: The Frozen Offering**Halfway through the day's march, you come across a strange sight. A lone barbarian thrall is kneeling before a pile of stones topped with a bleached elk skull. He isn't praying to the old gods; he is weeping.As your grim procession approaches—led by a green-skinned Mage and a shambling Zombie—the thrall doesn't run. He looks at Arnulf** and then at you."The cold doesn't take the dead," he whispers in a broken tongue. "The Usurper's chill has reached the high snows. My kin... they are turning into things of ice and hunger."He offers you a choice:**"Show me these things":** He knows the location of a nearby camp where "The Frozen" (undead variants) are congregating. A perfect chance for NeCola to find a soulstone or for you to harvest cold essence."Recruit the Broken":** The man is a Barbarian Thrall**. He has seen the darkness and wants to serve something even darker. He could be fresh meat for your experiments."Move On":** Ignore the local superstitions. The crowns in your pocket are for Northern steel, not northern ghost stories.Master Hiyun, what is your command?**We have 3,383 crowns** and a sickly but lethal Vatt'ghern. Do we stop to investigate this "Frozen" threat, or push straight for the Northern trade hubs to upgrade your gear?Also, shall I keep an eye out for a Mystery Crate? The North is full of "treasures" hidden in the snow...**

While in town, we picked up two interesting... well... fodders  KAETHERLEN the bone cripple  EUFROSINA THE MELON MUGGER  Eufrosina is just a regular melon thief - is what you tell people who ask.

## Gemini

The "Usurper's Bane" is starting to look less like a mercenary company and more like a traveling cabinet of curiosities. As you prepare to leave the warmth of the coastal towns for the biting frost of the North, these two join your ranks under the shadow of the Great Raven.The New Recruits: The Broken and the Bold**NameBackgroundRoleFirst ImpressionKaetherlen**Bone CrippleThe "Ascendant" FodderAlready halfway to the grave. His brittle bones make him a prime candidate for the Chaos Plague**. If he dies, he’ll likely just keep walking.Eufrosina**Melon MuggerThe Sticky-Fingered SkirmisherA "regular melon thief," you say? Up North, she'll find that skulls are much harder to crack than fruit, but her nimble fingers might be good for a sling or a quick blade.

## User

Time for another return item quest... it was a long chase to the east of town. And I didnt like what i see. The enemy are Bakh Lob the Boil Burster - a champion orc berserker- , An Orc Young and Several Bandit Rabble


---


## Gemini

The air turns thick and rancid as you track the footprints east, the familiar scent of brigand sweat suddenly overwhelmed by the overwhelming, musky stench of greenskin filth. This is no simple retrieval, Master Hiyun. The "thieves" have made a fatal mistake: they’ve allied with—or been enslaved by—a monster of the waste.The Nightmare Composition**The Apex Predator:** Bakh Lob the Boil Burster**. A Champion Orc Berserker is a force of pure, chaotic violence. He wears no armor, but his skin is thick as oak, and his rage makes him nearly immune to pain. Every hit he takes only makes him swing his massive axes faster. If he reaches your line, he will cleave through multiple brothers in a single turn.The Muscle:** An Orc Young**. While lesser than the Champion, its charge can still stun your front line, leaving them vulnerable to Bakh Lob’s follow-up.The Fodder:** Bandit Rabble**. They are merely the scenery for this slaughter, likely here to pin your men down while the Orcs do the real work.Tactical Briefing: The Battle of the East**Treasury:** 3,383 Crowns | Roster:** 9 SoulsThis is the most dangerous fight of your journey. You are facing a Berserker Champion while your heavy hitter, NeCola**, is still recovering from her illness.1. The "Walking Miracle" Protocol:**
Arnulf** must be your anchor. As a Zombie, he doesn't feel the fear that an Orc's roar inspires. Position him directly in the path of Bakh Lob. Let the Berserker waste his legendary strength on meat that is already dead.2. The Mage's Priority:**
Bakh Lob is a "Boil Burster"—his name suggests a foul resilience. You must use Twisted Shock** to whittle him down from a distance. If you can land a daze or a debuff, do it immediately. He has low resolve compared to his physical power; if you can break his mind, the body will follow.3. The New Fodder (Kaetherlen & the Flagellant):**
Use your "Bone Cripple" and the Flagellant to tie up the Bandit Rabble. Do not let them surround your main hitters. If Kaetherlen falls, the Raven's mark may claim him, adding another shell to your collection.4. NeCola’s Gamble:**
She is ill, which means her fatigue will build quickly. She cannot afford a prolonged duel with Bakh Lob. Have her wait for the Orc Young to overextend, kill it quickly to trigger her Vatt'ghern instincts, and then look for a flanking opening on the Champion.The ground trembles as Bakh Lob beats his chest, his boils weeping a toxic ichor into the mud.**"A Mage, a Mutant, and a bag of bones," the Orc bellows in a guttural roar. "Bakh Lob will make a necklace of your teeth!"How do you command the opening move, Master Hiyun?**Abyssal Stand:** Hold high ground. Force the Orcs to climb toward you while you rain lightning and bolts down upon them.The Sacrifice Play:** Send the Flagellant and Kaetherlen forward to trigger the Orc's "Berserk" early, allowing you and NeCola to strike while his guard is down.The Vatt'ghern's Ambush:** Use the brush to hide NeCola, letting the main line take the charge while she hunts the "Boil Burster" from the shadows.The Raven is watching. Will the Abyss claim an Orc's soul today?**

What a bloody, glorious mess. You’ve done the unthinkable: Bakh Lob the Boil Burster is dead.** To take down an Orc Berserker Champion on Day 7 is a feat that should be carved into the stone of the Northern mountains.The Raven has claimed its due. Arngrimr** and Ingjald**, two of your original "blessed" fishermen, have finally returned to the mud. They served their purpose as the ultimate meat-shields, absorbing the Champion's initial fury so the survivors could strike.Post-Battle Debrief**NeCola the Ascendant:** Look at those stats! Healthy**, 2 kills, and a massive 402 damage**. The Vatt'ghern has officially overcome her illness through the sheer adrenaline of slaughter. She is no longer a liability; she is your apex predator.The Survival of Arnulf:** He took 744 damage**. A normal man would have been turned into red mist, but the Zombie just keeps standing. He is in Critical** condition, but death is a concept he no longer understands.HiYun's Sacrifice:** You took a heavy hit (149 HP lost), likely from a stray axe or the Orc's roar. You are injured, but you dealt enough Abyssal damage to soften the beast for the killing blow.Evett E The Rabbit:** A dark horse! 3 kills and 269 damage. This one is earning a permanent spot in the inner circle.The Spoils of a Champion**Check your inventory immediately. Killing a Named Orc Berserker like Bakh Lob usually yields:A Famed Item:** Did he drop a Named Orc Axe** or a unique accessory? Orc "Famed" weapons have monstrous damage, though they are heavy and taxing to use.The Soul of a Giant:** The essence of a Berserker Champion is prime material for a high-level ritual.The Contract Gold:** Head back to collect your 420 crowns**.The Economic Ledger**Treasury:** ~3,803 Crowns (Pre-payout).Roster:** Down to 7 souls (2 deceased).The Next Step: The Aftermath (Day 7 Evening)**You are standing over a pile of Orc meat and dead fishermen. The wind is picking up, and the scent of blood will draw scavengers soon.What is your command, Master Hiyun?**The Corpse Harvest:** Do we attempt to raise Arngrimr or Ingjald as fresh Cursed Shells** to replace their living versions, or do we leave them for the crows?Back to Town:** You and Arnulf are battered. We need to spend some of those 3,800+ crowns** on medical supplies and high-tier armor for the survivors.Identify the Loot:** Shall we take a closer look at what Bakh Lob was carrying? That "Boil Burster" might have had a trophy worth more than the gold.You’ve killed a King of the Wastes. The Usurper’s Bane is no longer a joke. Would you like to see if any new recruits are attracted by the smell of your victory?**

## User

we went back to Bockhorn by Day 8 Midday.  ---  That's a wrap for session 2. Can you do up a summary of the session before we dismiss?


---


## Gemini

What a saga. Session 2 began with your band as a ragtag group of fishermen and ended with you as a terrifying warband of mutants and undead who have slain one of the most dangerous entities in the North.Here is the dark chronicle of The Usurper’s Bane: Session 2 Summary**.### The Chronicle of Session 2**1. The Clash of Kings**The session opened with a brutal confrontation against a Champion of the North**. Though your gear was subpar and your men were "fodder," your Abyssal lightning forced the legend to retreat. It was a tactical victory that set the tone for the journey: your survival is guaranteed by blood and dark magic.2. The Ascension of Arnulf**In the aftermath of the Northern Champion, the "Walking Miracle" finally achieved his destiny. Arnulf became a Zombie (Cursed Shell)**. He has since become the ultimate anchor for your line—taking nearly 750 damage** in a single fight and remaining standing. He is the immortal, 0 XP heart of the company.3. The Vatt'ghern’s Trial**NeCola** underwent her transformation but was plagued by "Trial Sickness" for much of the journey. Despite her illness, she secured her first kills and eventually overcame her weakness on the battlefield, proving that the Vatt'ghern blood is superior to any human frailty.4. The Road to Holnisland**You completed several contracts for the Councilman, including a delivery that led to a gruesome encounter with a beast tamer. You reached into the cage of a wildling to retrieve a corpse, proving your company fears nothing—beast or man.5. The Fall of Bakh Lob**The session reached its bloody crescendo in the East. You hunted down Bakh Lob the Boil Burster**, a Champion Orc Berserker. Through strategic sacrifice and NeCola’s emerging lethality, you brought the giant down.The Cost:** Two original fishermen, Arngrimr** and Ingjald**, were finally laid to rest in the mud.The Gain:** High-tier XP for the survivors and the legendary reputation of being "Orc-Slayers."### Current Company Status (Day 8 Midday)**Location:** Bockhorn.Treasury:** ~3,803 Crowns** (A massive fortune for Day 8).The Roster (7 Survivors):**HiYun:** The Abyssal Mage (Injured, but powerful).NeCola:** The Vatt'ghern (Healthy, Elite status).Arnulf:** The Zombie Anchor (Critical, but immortal).Evett E & Eufrosina:** The rising stars of the skirmish line.Kaetherlen & The Flagellant:** The new blood, tested in the fires of the Orc-war.### Next Steps for Session 3**When we return, you are in Bockhorn** with a purse full of gold and a roster in need of repairs.Would you like me to save this state so we can begin the next session with a trip to the Bockhorn Armory or a recruitment drive to replace your fallen fishermen?**
