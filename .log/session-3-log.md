Let's go for session 3

## Gemini

Welcome back, Master HiYun. The air in Bockhorn is thick with the scent of wet stone and woodsmoke as the sun hangs high on Day 8**. Your treasury is heavy with 3,803 crowns**—a fortune carved out of the hides of orcs and the pockets of desperate councilmen.


---


## User

Let's take this quest:  OBJECTIVES  Deliver cargo to Guillabert the Wise in Fuhrtmark about a day to the east by road  PAYMENT  Get 40 crowns in advance  Get 170 crowns on completion


---


## Gemini

A simple delivery. It’s almost beneath a master of the Abyssal arts, but even the void needs coin to grease the wheels of progress. You take the heavy, wax-sealed satchel from the councilman, the 40 crowns clinking into your purse with a satisfying weight.Fuhrtmark** lies about a day’s march to the east. The road is well-traveled, but in these lands, "well-traveled" just means the brigands know exactly where to wait.The March EastAs the Usurper's Bane** leaves the gates of Bockhorn, the mood is grim but professional.NeCola** is draped in a heavy cloak, her unnaturally pale skin shielded from the sun as she recovers from the Trial.Arnulf** trudges at the rear, his shambling gait rhythmic and tireless.The rest of the men keep their hands on their pommels, eyes scanning the treeline for any sign of the "Usurper's" influence—or perhaps just hungry wolves.Mid-Journey EncounterA few hours into the trek, you spot a group of haggard refugees** huddled by a burnt-out waystation. They look at your company with a mix of terror and hope. One man, seeing your robes and the strange mutations of your companions, crawls forward."Lord... please. We fled from the east. The earth there... it’s breathing. We lost everything. If you have any spare food, or if you seek hands to work, we are desperate."*How do you handle these wretches?**[Recruit]** "Life is cheap, but service is eternal." (Inspect them for potential recruits/thralls).[Ignore]** "The Abyssal Mage has no time for beggars." (Keep moving toward Fuhrtmark).[Intimidate]** "Tell me more of this 'breathing earth'—or I'll give you to the Walking Miracle." (Demand intelligence on the region).Or, would you like to check the Bockhorn marketplace one last time before we get too far, or perhaps adjust your formation for the road?**

We began our journey by making a stop at Turmfeste. We reached there by Day 8 Night. Nothing much was going on so we camped outside of town to heal. In the morning we entered town to look for possible recruit and trade. Trading prices were good so we sold off a lot of the stuff in our inventory. we now sit at 3452 crows after payment of salary. Its now day 9 morning. we continue to Fuhrtmark


---


## Gemini

The stop at Turmfeste** was wise. The morning air is crisp, and your inventory is lighter, replaced by the comforting weight of 3,452 crowns**. With your gear organized and your pockets lined, you leave the fortress behind and head back onto the road to Fuhrtmark**.As you march, the terrain begins to shift from the rocky hills near the fortress to the dense, shadows-choked forests of the East.The Arrival at FuhrtmarkBy late afternoon on Day 9**, the village of Fuhrtmark comes into view. It is a cluster of thatched roofs surrounded by a modest wooden palisade. You find Guillabert the Wise** near the village center, poring over a dusty map. He looks up, his eyes widening as he takes in the sight of your company—especially the silent, looming presence of Arnulf**."The cargo! You've arrived. I began to fear the road had swallowed you whole, as it has so many others lately,"* he mutters, handing over the remaining 170 crowns**.Current Status:Treasury:** 3,622 Crowns.Company Health:** NeCola’s fever is fading; she should be battle-ready very soon.Location:** Fuhrtmark (Village).Your Next Move in FuhrtmarkFuhrtmark is smaller than Bockhorn, but its isolation often means more desperate—and high-paying—work.Check the Local Tavern:** See if there are any unique backgrounds available (perhaps a local woodsman or an apprentice).Negotiate a New Contract:** There is a rumor of missing villagers** and unnatural tracks** in the nearby woods.Visit the Marketplace:** Check for cheap tools or specialized regional food to keep morale high.Shall we look for a new contract here, or do you have another destination in mind for the Usurper's Bane?**

## User

At Fuhrtmark we encounted an event to recruit an APPRENTICE  An impatient student of a Swordmaster, Jan F didn't have the mental aptitude to stick with the trials and tribulations of becoming a master of the blade himself. But what he lacks in mental fortitude he more than makes up for in effort. You 'hired' him simply by taking him off the old man's hands.


---


## Gemini

A stroke of luck, Master. While most seek out veterans, there is a dark irony in taking a Swordmaster's "failure" and molding him into something far more lethal under your tutelage. Jan F** may have lacked the patience for traditional forms, but the Usurper's Bane** doesn't care for grace—only results.As an Apprentice**, Jan F typically boasts a higher-than-average Fatigue pool and a decent Melee Skill base. More importantly, he learns quickly. With a bit of "motivation" from your Abyssal influence, his wasted effort can be refined into cold, hard efficiency.Fuhrtmark Update: Day 9With Jan F added to the roster, the company feels more balanced. However, adding another mouth to feed and another sword to sharpen means your daily expenses will climb.Current Roster:**HiYun** (Abyssal Mage)NeCola** (Vatt'ghern - recovering)Arnulf** (Undead Tank)Evett E, Eufrosina, Kaetherlen, Flagellant**Jan F** (Apprentice - New**)Treasury:** ~3,622 Crowns (minus any small signing fees or supplies bought).What is Jan F’s role?Before we look for work, how shall we slot the boy in?Frontline Fodder:** Give him a shield and a spear; let him prove his "effort" by holding the line for the veterans.The Duelist-in-Training:** Give him the best one-handed weapon you have and keep him near NeCola to learn how to truly kill.The Guard:** Keep him in the backline for now until we find him some decent armor.Once his position is set, shall we check the Fuhrtmark notice board? I hear there's a contract involving "uninvited guests" in a nearby graveyard.**

## User

Too bad for Jan, he is nothing but a fodder. Moving on, we take on a quest to return item  OBJECTIVES  Follow the tracks near Fuhrtmark  e Return Antique Book of Bloodlines to Fuhrtmark  PAYMENT  Get 130 crowns in advance  Get 540 crowns on completion  We found the thieves just north of town. Interestingly, they were just Many Bandit Rabble


---


## Gemini

A wise, if cold, assessment. Jan F** wanted to learn the way of the sword; he’ll soon learn that in your service, the "way of the sword" mostly involves catching axes with his face so your more valuable assets stay pristine.The contract is lucrative—670 crowns** total for a simple recovery. The "Antique Book of Bloodlines" sounds like exactly the kind of text an Abyssal Mage might want to skim before handing it back to these peasants.The Skirmish: North of FuhrtmarkYou track the thieves barely a stone's throw from the village gates. It’s a pathetic sight: Many Bandit Rabble**. These aren't hardened brigands; they are desperate men in rags, clutching rusted knives and sharpened sticks. They clearly have no idea who—or what*—they’ve stolen from.Battle Lines Drawn:**The Frontline:** Your core group forms a wall of steel and malice.The "Student":** Jan F is pushed to the front. His grip on his shield is white-knuckled as he stares at the mob of rabble.The Undead:** Arnulf stands motionless, a terrifying omen of what happens to those who fall against you.The rabble outnumber you, but they lack armor, discipline, and the favor of the Abyss. They begin to close in, shouting half-hearted threats to bolster their failing courage.How shall we resolve this slaughter?[Aggressive Charge]:** Let the veterans lead the way to end this quickly.[Trial by Fire]:** Order Jan F and the newer recruits to hold the center alone to see who is worth keeping.[Arcane Dominance]:** Use your own powers to break their morale before they even reach your line.Shall I narrate the bloody details of the combat, or do you wish to skip to the aftermath and the loot found alongside the Book of Bloodlines?**

## User

Well `many` was unclear. It was 16! Still, it was a easy fight:  ---  VICTORY  The enemy retreated after 4 rounds  Statistics Loot  HiYun 0 kills 0 damage XP 96 0 wounds  NeCola The Vatt’Ghern 3 kills 328 damage XP 100 0 wounds  Bardol F 1 kill 97 damage XP 62 0 wounds  Arnulf F 1 kill 97 damage XP 66 0 wounds  Evett E The Rabbit 2 kills 134 damage XP 101 0 wounds  Kaetherlen 1 kill 73 damage XP 67 0 wounds  Eufrosina The Melon Mugger 2 kills 87 damage XP 95 0 wounds  Jan F The Bright 1 kill 64 damage XP 101 6 wounds  ---


---


## Gemini

Sixteen souls stood against you, and sixteen souls learned the folly of their ambition. They thought numbers would save them; they didn't realize that against the Usurper's Bane**, sixteen pieces of rabble just means sixteen targets.The AftermathThe fight was a surgical slaughter. NeCola** is clearly back in top form, carving through three men and dealing a massive 328 damage**—her Vatt’ghern instincts are sharpening into a lethal edge. Even Jan F**, despite his "fodder" status, managed to spill blood and secure a kill, though he paid for his "Bright" enthusiasm with six wounds**. He’ll have some scars to show for his first day on the job.The cowards turned tail after only four rounds, realizing that steel and sorcery aren't things you can beat with desperation.Spoils of WarYou retrieve the Antique Book of Bloodlines** from the dirt. It’s slightly blood-spattered now, which arguably adds character.Crowns:** You have the 540 crowns** completion bonus waiting for you back in Fuhrtmark.Experience:** A solid spread across the board. Evett E** and Jan F** both broke the 100 XP mark this encounter.Loot:** Aside from the book, you likely stripped the bodies of any usable rags, rusted blades, or pocketed change.Back to FuhrtmarkYou return to the village as victors. The commoners give you a wide berth, eyes darting between the bloody book in your hand and the shambling, tireless Arnulf**.What is your next move, Master HiYun?**Turn in the Book:** Collect your 540 crowns and see if the village elders have grown more generous with their tasks.Level Up & Perk Selection:** With the XP gained, several brothers are ready to grow stronger. Shall we go through their new skills? (Especially Jan F, if he survived well enough to earn a reward).Medical Attention:** Jan F is bleeding. We can use supplies to patch him up, or simply let him "toughen up" the hard way.The Merchant:** Sell off the junk stripped from the 16 rabble to further pad the treasury.Your orders?**

Whats even better is that another group of 10 rabbles were just behind this group. We quickly move in to use them as traning dummies:  ---  HIYUN  1 skull 0 sword(=damage)  XP 74 0 drop(=injury)  NECOLA THE VATT’GHERN  3 skulls 271 sword  XP 72 0 drop  BARDOL F  0 skulls 0 sword  XP 34 0 drop  ARNULF F  0 skulls 0 sword  XP 36 0 drop  EVETT E THE RABBIT  2 skulls 135 sword  XP 66 0 drop  KAETHERLEN  1 skull 65 sword  XP 43 0 drop  EUFROSINA THE MELON MUGGER  0 skulls 63 sword  XP 44 0 drop  JAN F THE BRIGHT  0 skulls 67 sword  XP 51 0 drop  ---

## Gemini

Ten more? It’s less of a war and more of a harvest at this point. You fell upon the second group before they could even process the massacre of their comrades. Between the two fights, you’ve cleared 26 enemies** in a single morning.The Tally of the HarvestNeCola** is becoming a whirlwind of blades, adding another 3 kills and nearly 300 damage to her record. Evett E** is proving remarkably consistent, earning her "The Rabbit" moniker perhaps through speed and lethal precision.Interestingly, Jan F**—our "fodder" apprentice—has survived two back-to-back battles. He didn't secure a kill in this second bout, but 67 damage shows he’s swinging that sword with intent. He’s either very lucky or tougher than he looks.Status Check: Day 9 MiddayThe "Usurper's Bane" stands on a road littered with the bodies of the desperate.Total Treasury:** ~4,162 Crowns (assuming the 540 completion is coming up next).Condition:** Excellent. Aside from Jan F’s lingering wounds from the first bout, the company is untouched.Training:** The "dummies" served their purpose. Your core members are rapidly gaining the veterancy needed for real threats.Returning to FuhrtmarkYou stride back into town with the Antique Book of Bloodlines**, likely tucked under your arm while the rest of the company wipes bandit blood from their boots.What shall we do with our newfound momentum?**Collect the Reward:** Turn in the book for the 540 crowns**.Roster Management:** Jan F has 152 XP total now. If he levels up, shall we double down on his "fodder" status with Colossus/Nine Lives**, or try to salvage him into a real soldier?Market Sweep:** With over 4,000 crowns potentially in pocket, Fuhrtmark might have some decent armor or a better weapon for Kaetherlen** or Eufrosina**.Look for the Next Lead:** After slaughtering 26 men, word will travel. See if the "Wise" Guillabert has a more challenging (and lucrative) task for a Mage of your caliber.How do you wish to proceed, Master HiYun?**

## User

It's the next morning when we got back to the twon. we were paid as promised. There a different local elder has a challenging quest for me:  ---  Garcia the Steward waves a hand dismissively, barely looking up from the papers on his desk.  "There's been some nonsense about ghosts out by the old quarry. Miners gone missing, torches going out, screams in the night - all very dramatic, I'm sure. I sent a few men to check, and, well... they didn't come back. Unfortunate, but such things happen when people wander where they shouldn't."  He sighs, glancing out the window as if bored already.  "Anyway, I heard your company's got a vatt'ghern - one of those monster-hunting sorts. Seems just the sort of mess for them. Go have a look, swing a few swords around, and if the problem stops, I'll see some coin sent your way. If not... well, we'll know it wasn't worth the trouble."  Sounds like a dangerous job, how many crowns?  He smiles.  "This will make you rich, my friend. You are to receive 2640 crowns when the contract is done."  OBJECTIVES  Purge Drafty Shack of Geists, south-east of Fuhrtmark  PAYMENT  Get 2640 crowns on completion  ---


---


## Gemini

A heavy silence falls over the steward’s office as he utters that number. 2,640 crowns.** In the world of Battle Brothers*, that is not just a payment—it is a death sentence for the unprepared. Garcia the Steward is essentially offering you a small fortune to walk into a blender.The Analysis of the VoidGeists.** These are not "training dummies" like the bandit rabble you just harvested. Geists are ethereal horrors that:Cannot be hit easily** (high defense).Ignore armor** with their screams.Scream to break the Resolve** of your entire line, turning brave men into fleeing cowards in a single turn.The Risk:** If your men break and flee, the Geists will simply float after them and slice them down. Jan F** and your newer recruits are at extreme risk here; their Resolve is likely brittle. Arnulf**, being undead, might be your most reliable anchor, as he knows no fear.The Asset:** The Steward specifically mentioned NeCola**. As a Vatt'ghern, she is built for this. Her increased initiative and potential for high-damage bursts are your best bet to "delete" the Geists before they can let out a second scream.Preparing for the "Drafty Shack"With over 4,000 crowns** currently in your purse and another 2,640 promised, you have the capital to prepare properly. Before you head south-east:Bolster Resolve:** Do you have any trophies or gear that increases Bravery? If not, a trip to the Tavern** for a round of drinks might temporarily boost morale before the march.The Sergeant:** Do you have a brother with high Resolve to act as a Rallying point? If a Geist screams and the "Usurper's Bane" starts to run, you need someone to yell them back into formation.Weaponry:** Geists have almost no HP but are hard to hit. Fast, accurate weapons (Spears/Swords) or reaching weapons (Pikes) are better than heavy axes here.The DecisionThe "Drafty Shack" lies to the south-east. The air already feels colder just thinking about it.[Accept]:** "The Abyss fears no ghosts. We march at dawn."[Prepare First]:** Spend some of your 4,000 crowns in the Fuhrtmark market on better helmets or Resolve-boosting items before leaving.[Haggle/Inquire]:** Ask the Steward if he has any more information on how many* Geists were seen.What are your orders, Master HiYun? Shall we risk the souls of your company for a king's ransom?**

This was a much tougher fight... but we won  ---  Based on the provided victory screen, the battle lasted 12 rounds. The following is a breakdown of the statistics for the company members involved:  Active Combatants  Necola the Vatt'ghern: Secured the most kills with 2 and dealt 688 damage, earning 448 XP.  HiYun: Recorded 1 kill and 18 damage, earning 477 XP.  Kaetherlen: Recorded 0 kills and 201 damage, earning 260 XP.  Injured & Fallen Members  Jan F the Bright: Earned 52 XP and 4 damage but sustained 177 HP damage.  Arnulf F: Earned 37 XP with 0 kills/damage and sustained 200 HP damage.  Bardol F: Earned 35 XP and sustained 135 HP damage.  Evett E the Rabbit: Earned 0 XP and sustained 67 HP damage.  Eufrosina the Melon Mugger: Earned 0 XP and sustained 94 HP damage - he died permanatly in this fight (hurray?)


---


## Gemini

Twelve rounds in the shadow of that Drafty Shack. The screams of the Geists must have been deafening, tearing at the very sanity of your men. You walked into a nightmare and dragged a victory out by its throat.The Toll of the VoidEufrosina the "Melon Mugger"** is gone. In the grim reality of your crusade, his death is a "hurray"—one less mouth to feed, and a soul returned to the Great Raven. His sacrifice provided the distraction needed for the heavy hitters to do their work.Arnulf** continues his streak of impossible survival, soaking up 200 HP damage** and somehow remaining "upright." He is truly the ultimate anvil. Jan F**, our fodder apprentice, took a staggering 177 damage**; he is likely more scar tissue than man at this point, but he's learning what it means to serve the Abyss.The Stars of the ShowNeCola:** A masterclass in monster hunting. 688 damage** against ethereal Geists is staggering. She was the silver blade in the dark that kept the company from being completely unraveled.HiYun:** You stepped into the fray yourself, securing a kill and gaining a massive 477 XP**. The master leads from the front when the dead start to scream.Victory & RewardsYou return to Garcia the Steward, the air around you still smelling of ozone and grave dust. He looks pale as he hands over the heavy chest of coin.Payment Received:** 2,640 Crowns.Current Treasury:** ~6,800+ Crowns (A kingly sum for Day 10).Company Status:** Battered, bloodied, and one "Melon Mugger" lighter.What is your next move, Master?With nearly 7,000 crowns, the Usurper's Bane** is no longer a band of starving mercenaries; you are a regional power.Massive Upgrading:** Head to the nearest Citadel or large town. It’s time to buy Plate Armor, Greatswords, or specialized Vatt'ghern gear**. No more rags.Fill the Ranks:** You have a hole in your line where Eufrosina stood. Do we look for high-tier recruits (Hedge Knights, Sellswords) or find more "volunteers" to test the Chaos Plague?Level Up:** NeCola and HiYun have gained massive XP. Shall we select their new Perks**? NeCola is likely ready for some truly elite Vatt'ghern traits.The Usurper's Trail:** With this kind of gold, we could begin hunting for the Usurper's Dungeon** or other high-threat targets.How shall we spend this blood-soaked fortune?**

## User

We returned to tow a much richer group. After trading off some loot, we are sitting at 9613 crowns. We took on a courier quest that will take us back to Stohl, where we started. The idea was to pass by the Raven Watch to recruit some quality fighters. That was the idea at least. our package ended up being stolen just outside of Fuhrtmark... now i have to run after the thieves and cut them down before moving on with my plan. It is now Day 10 night


---


## Gemini

The irony is delicious, Master. You carry nearly 10,000 crowns**—enough to buy a minor lordship—and yet some gutter-born thieves think your courier satchel is worth their lives. They’ve delayed your pilgrimage to Raven Watch**, and for that, the price is paid in blood.The Midnight Hunt (Day 10 Night)The trail is fresh, leading into the dark woods outside Fuhrtmark. Under the silver moon, your company looks like a pack of nightmares. NeCola’s** cat-like eyes catch the faint disturbances in the underbrush, while Arnulf** follows behind, his tireless, silent stride unyielding.The thieves likely expect a frustrated merchant or a few town guards. They aren't prepared for the Abyssal Mage** and a Vatt'ghern** who just survived a Geist's scream.Battle Preparation: The Thieves' AmbushYou’ve cornered them at a small campfire. They are likely a mix of Brigand Thugs** and perhaps a Poacher** or two. Given your recent victory against Geists, this should be a "palate cleanser"—a quick slaughter to vent your frustration.Current Roster (7/27):**HiYun** (Abyssal Mage)NeCola** (Vatt'ghern - The Reaper)Arnulf** (Undead Tank - 0 HP damage now?)Bardol F, Evett E, Kaetherlen**Jan F** (The "Indestructible" Fodder)The Objective:** Recover the stolen package.
Note: If the thieves have a Marksman, keep an eye on Jan F; he’s already been through a meat grinder and might not survive another lucky bolt.*How shall we handle these "bold" entrepreneurs?[No Quarter]:** Surround them and ensure not a single one escapes to tell the tale. We need that package back immediately to stay on schedule for Raven Watch.[The Raven’s Terror]:** Let NeCola dash into their midst and see how many heads roll before they can even draw their daggers.[The Dark Experiment]:** Use your Abyssal powers to break their minds. If any survive the first volley, perhaps they are "worthy" of the Chaos Plague?Once we recover the package, the road to Raven Watch awaits. Who are you hoping to find there? A seasoned Sellsword to replace the Melon Mugger, or perhaps a more exotic background suited for the Raven's service?**

The tracks led us to a WOBBLY SHELTER the next morning. It was an abandoned homestead with a collapsed roof. Inside of it is  Several Brigand Thugs  A few Brigand Poachers  A Wardog  A Possessed Witchhunter


---


## Gemini

The morning sun catches the glint of stolen steel within the ruins of the Wobbly Shelter**. This isn't just a pack of desperate thieves; they have a "shepherd." A Possessed Witchhunter** leading a band of brigands is a grim omen. In these lands, the "Possessed" often carry the taint of the Usurper—fanatics whose minds have been hollowed out and filled with something far more violent than gold-lust.The Witchhunter** is the true threat here. They are usually armed with crossbows or sidearms and possess high Resolve and dangerous accuracy. If he is truly Possessed*, he might even shrug off wounds that would fell a normal man.Tactical Briefing: The Homestead SiegeThe Frontline:** Your core team, bolstered by the "Undead Tank" Arnulf**, must push quickly to jam the Poachers** and the Witchhunter** before they can rain bolts upon your less-armored members.The Vatt'ghern's Mark:** NeCola** should prioritize the Witchhunter. If he has a crossbow, he is a direct threat to you, Master HiYun.The Wardog:** Watch out for the dog being unleashed early to tie up your backline or flank Jan F**.Jan F** is still held together by sheer willpower and scar tissue after his 177 HP bruising from the Geists. If a Brigand Thug gets a lucky swing with a flail, the "Bright" apprentice might finally see the light.The Battle BeginsThe Brigands huddle behind the collapsed walls of the homestead, the Witchhunter’s eyes glowing with an unnatural, feverish intensity as he barks orders.How shall we execute this recovery?**[Surgical Strike]:** Order NeCola to flank and assassinate the Witchhunter while the rest of the line holds the Thugs.[Abyssal Shield]:** Use the ruins for cover, forcing them to come to you, then unleash your own dark arts as they enter the open.[The Meat Grinder]:** Send Jan F and Arnulf straight through the front door to draw all the fire and aggression while the veterans pick them apart.What is your command? Once these thieves are cold, we can finally fulfill the courier contract and make for Raven Watch with our 10,000 crowns.**

Whoops some of us get struck down again. Let's pretend i didnt send them to die on purpose not having even healed after the last two fights hehehehe.

## Gemini

"A calculated sacrifice is still a sacrifice, Master," the Great Raven seems to whisper through the rustling leaves of the homestead.Sending wounded men into a den of possessed zealots and warhounds is certainly... efficient. You've weeded out the weak and ensured the survivors are either too tough or too terrified to die.The Butcher's Bill:Evett E "The Rabbit":** She lived up to her name, perhaps trying to outrun the Wardog, but took a brutal 136 damage**. If she survived, she’s likely more "scar" than "rabbit" now.Arnulf & Bardol:** These two are your living shields. They stood in the doorway, soaked up the Witchhunter's spite (130 combined damage**), and did exactly what they were "not-purposely" sent to do.NeCola:** Absolute dominance. 569 damage and 4 kills**. She tore through those poachers and the Witchhunter like a gale of cold steel.The Stolen Package is recovered.** You find the wax-sealed courier satchel clutched in the dead Witchhunter's cold hand. Whatever is inside must be important for a possessed man to guard it so fiercely.Status Update: Day 11 MorningThe "Usurper's Bane" is now a collection of walking wounded, but the road to Stohl** and the Raven Watch** is open.Treasury:** ~9,800 Crowns (after selling the Witchhunter's gear).Injuries:** High. Almost everyone needs bandages, rest, and prayer (or at least some dark incantations).Inventory:** You have the Stolen Package and a pile of brigand loot.Your Next Step:We are halfway back to your starting lands.Push to Stohl:** Complete the courier quest immediately for the payout and a clean slate.The Raven Watch Detour:** Swing by the Watch now. With nearly 10,000 crowns, you don't just "recruit"—you buy** the best. You're looking for high-end backgrounds to anchor your line.The Apothecary:** Your men are in rough shape. If Stohl has an alchemist, we should restock on medicinal supplies before Jan F's wounds turn green.Shall we head straight to Raven Watch to find your next elite "student," or do we drop the package in Stohl first?**

## User

Bardol Arnulf both collected 4 perma injury while Evett and Jan are at one or two... Evett is zombified have i mentioned?


---


## Gemini

By the Raven's feathers, the Usurper's Bane** is starting to look more like a traveling charnel house than a mercenary company!Bardol and Arnulf** are essentially mosaics of scar tissue and broken bone at this point. Four permanent injuries each? In any other company, they’d be retired to a life of begging; in yours, they are simply "seasoned."And Evett E**... I should have guessed. The transition to a Zombified** state (likely via the Chaos Plague* or the Raven's "last laugh") explains how she survived 136 damage. She’s no longer "The Rabbit" because of her speed, but because she just keeps coming back from the burrow of the grave.State of the Company: Day 11You are sitting on a literal mountain of gold (9,613 crowns**) while leading a squad of "walking wounded" (and just plain "walking dead").HiYun:** The Master, untouched and wealthy.NeCola:** The Apex Predator. 4 kills and 569 damage while the rest of the team was busy falling apart.The Meat Shields:** Bardol and Arnulf (The Swiss Cheese Brothers).The Apprentice:** Jan F (The Unbreakable Fodder).The Revenant:** Evett E (Zombified).The Raven Watch AwaitsThe Stolen Package** is back in your hands. Stohl is close, but the Raven Watch** is the priority. With nearly 10,000 crowns, you aren't just looking for "quality fighters"—you are looking for Legends**.At the Watch, you might find:Vatt'ghern Candidates:** Higher-tier backgrounds that can survive the mutations NeCola mastered.Heavy Infantry:** Hedge Knights or Oathkeepers who can actually wear the plate armor you’re about to buy.Witchers/Slayers:** Since you have the coin, you might find someone who doesn't need to be "zombified" just to stay standing.Your Move, MasterThe sun is rising on Day 11. The stench of rot from Evett and the rattling of Bardol's broken ribs accompany the clinking of your 9,000+ crowns.Shall we make the final push to Raven Watch to spend that fortune on some fresh (or at least less-broken) meat? Or do you want to stop in Stohl first to clear the contract and maybe buy some tools to "repair" your injured thralls?**

We reached Raven Town Day 11 midday. I havent gotten to look around. Let's wrap up the session for now


---


## Gemini

The gates of Raven Town** groan open to admit your macabre procession. It is a fitting end to a bloody chapter. Under the midday sun, the townsfolk pull their children away from the street as you pass—a Master of the Abyss leading a silent, slitted-eyed Vatt'ghern, a hollow-cheeked Apprentice, and a literal zombie in rusted mail.You have survived the Geists, crushed the Possessed, and turned the "Usurper's" own chaos against your enemies. Your purse is overflowing, but your men are held together by little more than dark magic and stubbornness.Session 3 Conclusion: The Butcher’s Ledger**The State of the Usurper's Bane:**The Treasury:** A staggering 9,613 crowns**. You are among the wealthiest mercenary leaders in the realm for only being on Day 11.The Elite:** NeCola** is now a certified engine of destruction.
