Session 6 starts now. Its Day 15 Midday. We stand at the gate of Makan Muqadas. With only 6 out of 12 bros I have space for. Let's look into recruiting


---


## Gemini

The sun beats down on the sand-swept walls of Makan Muqadas**. You stand before the gates, the scent of spice and dried leather hanging heavy in the midday heat. Your company is lean—only six men remain to hold the line. The empty slots in your roster are a silent reminder of the dangers you've faced, but the bustling city ahead promises fresh blood for the right price.You head toward the local marketplace and the shaded corners of the caravanserai where men looking for work tend to congregate.Available Recruits**NameBackgroundCostInitial ImpressionIbrahim**Indebted90Skinny, but has the look of a man with nothing left to lose.Jaffar**Nomad450Lean, sun-hardened, and carries his scimitar with practiced ease.Ardeshir**Eunuch200Quiet and observant; likely accustomed to pain and long hours.Qadir**Caravan Hand320Sturdy build; used to walking long distances and hauling gear.Suleiman**Peddler150Quick-tongued and agile, though perhaps lacks a warrior's heart.

MUYAHID IBN NUSA is our choice.  BACKGROUND:  SHEPHERD  Tending sheep was the easiest job  Muyahid could find. But one day,  textiling while tending, he led every  last sheep over a cliff. Muyahid  knows the stars surprisingly well and  can locate a sound in the darkness  like a blind dog sniffing a treat.


---


## Gemini

A bold choice. Muyahid Ibn Nusa** steps forward, dusting the sand from his worn tunic. He might have a history of distracted sheep-driving, but that keen ear and knowledge of the heavens could be the difference between an ambush and a windfall in the dark desert nights.He joins the company, looking a bit relieved to be trading a shepherd's crook for a mercenary's spear.Updated Roster: 7 / 12**Muyahid Ibn Nusa** (Shepherd) has been added to the ranks.Trait Note:** His ability to locate sound in the darkness will be a boon for the Abyssal Mage's nighttime operations.Would you like to head to the Marketplace to buy Muyahid some basic gear, or shall we look for one more recruit to bolster the front line?**

That's everything interesting in town. Let's take a quest to get rid of some nomads. Here's how the contract started.  ---  Bilal Al-Fad the Vizier of War is partly sitting on a throne of silken cushions, and partly on the bodies of a harem of attractive women. He puts his hand up.  "If you step further, Crownling, then you will grow in sight but diminish in view, understand? A smart man knows his place. I have a simple task for your swordhand. Nomads outside Makan Muqadas have taken to thievery and thuggery. For a handsome handsel, I need you to annihilate these men who have made my life uncomfortable."  "This will make you rich, my friend. You'll be paid 850 crowns when the contract is done."


---


## Gemini

The Vizier barely shifts his weight atop his human throne as he dismisses you with a flick of a ring-adorned finger. The weight of 850 crowns** is a tempting prospect for a company currently sitting at half-strength, even if the Vizier’s metaphors are as thick as the incense in his chambers.You lead your seven brothers—including the newly recruited shepherd, Muyahid—out through the city gates. The midday heat ripples over the dunes, making the horizon shimmer. It doesn't take long for your scouts to pick up the trail; a group of Nomads has been sighted to the south, tucked between the rocky outcrops that break the desert's monotony.The Encounter**As you crest a sandy ridge, you spot them: a band of Outcasts and Nomads**. They are lean, desperate men wrapped in sun-bleached linens, clutching notched scimitars and wooden bucklers. They haven't seen you yet, but the wind is shifting.Current Party Composition:** 7 Brothers (including Muyahid Ibn Nusa).Shall we move in for a proactive strike while the sun is high, or would you like to wait for nightfall to let Muyahid use his keen ears and celestial knowledge to catch them off guard?**

## User

It was the night of Day 15 when we found the nomads at White sands Camp east of Makan Muqadas. The nomads hide their camps well to avoid unwanted visitors or pursuing soldiers of the city states. Inside of it we found some worthy foes:  An Orc Warrior  A few Nomad Cutthroats  A Nomad Slinger  A Nomad Archer  A Forsaken  I will report the battle result in next message


---


## Gemini

The moon hangs low over the White Sands Camp**, casting long, jagged shadows across the dunes. The Vizier wasn't kidding about "uncomfortable"—this isn't just a pack of petty thieves. Finding an Orc Warrior** playing bedfellow with Nomads** and a Forsaken** is a grim omen. The heavy breathing of the green-skin and the unnerving silence of the Forsaken contrast sharply with the hushed whispers of the Cutthroats.Your seven brothers crouch in the cool sand, weapons drawn. Muyahid Ibn Nusa** stares at the stars, then tilts his head, tracking the heavy thud of the Orc’s footsteps and the whistling wind through the archers' bows. The darkness is your ally, but the sheer power of that Orc Warrior looms large over the small camp.The Abyssal Mage's company readies for blood. I am ready to record the toll of the battle—report the results when you are ready.**

What can i say, i didnt went well for our new recruit... He was cleaved up by the Orc and now zombiifed. Well thats 1000 crown down the drain. Fodder he is now.  ---  VICTORY  The enemy was destroyed in 6 rounds  Statistics Loot  | Character | Kills | Damage Dealt | XP Gained | Damage Taken |  |---|---|---|---|---|  | HIYUN | 0 | 196 | 105 | 0 |  | NECOLA THE VATT'GHERN | 2 | 369 | 186 | 0 |  | KAETHERLEN E | 0 | 130 | 62 | 53 |  | WILFRIED B | 1 | 287 | 104 | 67 |  | ABANOUB E IBN MANSUR | 0 | 0 | 85 | 0 |  | DAUID | 0 | 0 | 0 | 101 |  | MUYAHID D THROW | 0 | 33 | 85 | 123 |

## Gemini

A bitter victory in the dunes. The Vizier's crowns will taste of iron and sand today. Muyahid Ibn Nusa’s** career as a mercenary was as short-lived as his time as a shepherd—cleaved apart by the Orc Warrior's brute strength before he could even prove his worth.Yet, under the influence of the Abyssal Mage, death is not an exit, but a promotion to "permanent fodder." The shepherd who once followed stars now follows only the scent of living flesh as a zombified thrall.Battle Aftermath: White Sands Camp**The desert floor is littered with the bodies of the Nomads and the hulking remains of the Orc. Your veterans, Necola the Vatt'ghern** and Wilfried B**, carried the brunt of the lethality, while Dauid** barely clung to life, taking a staggering amount of punishment.Casualties:** Muyahid Ibn Nusa (Killed & Raised as Zombie).Wounded:** Dauid (101 Damage Taken), Kaetherlen E, and Wilfried B are nursing gashes and bruises.The Prize:** The camp is yours, and the contract is ready for collection.The 850 crowns from Bilal Al-Fad await, plus whatever loot you stripped from the Orc and the Forsaken.Shall we head back to Makan Muqadas to claim the gold and see if the healer has anything for Dauid’s wounds, or do you want to inspect the loot first?**

## User

We returned to our employer on Day 16 midday  ---  You try to enter Bilal Al-Fad the Vizier of War's room but a large, scarred guard lowers the business end of a polearm across the door.  "No visitors."  You state that you have business with the Vizier. The guard shakes his head. A servant comes up behind you and puts a satchel in your arms and then departs just as fast. The guard returns the polearm to his side.  "Your trivialities with the Vizier concluded when you first departed his presence. You are not to poison his mood any further. Leave. Now. Before you poison mine."


---


## Gemini

The heavy thud of the polearm against the floor echoes the Vizier’s cold dismissal. In the gilded halls of Makan Muqadas**, you are clearly nothing more than a tool—used, paid, and discarded before you can track sand onto the silk carpets.The satchel is heavy with the promised 850 crowns**, though it feels a meager sum for the life of a man and the near-death of another. Outside the palace, the midday sun is unforgiving, and the "new" Muyahid—shambling and mindless—draws nervous glances from the city guard.Current Company Status**Treasury:** +850 Crowns.The Roster:** 6 Living Brothers, 1 Zombie Thrall (Muyahid).The Wounded:** Dauid** is in rough shape; he needs rest or medical supplies if he's to survive the next march.The Vizier’s doors are shut tight, and the "Crownling" is no longer welcome in his sight. You stand in the city square with gold in your purse and the stench of decay clinging to your newest "recruit."Shall we head to the Alchemist to look for medicine for Dauid, or perhaps visit the Tavern to see if the rumors there are more welcoming than the Vizier's guards?**

We headed towards Ras Karim and reached by Day17 midday. It was a long desert walk but we are here for the areana crowns and we can take 3 today!


---


## Gemini

The trek to Ras Karim** across the shifting sands was grueling, but the sight of the city's towering arena walls brings a grim sense of purpose. The heat here feels different—it’s the heat of blood-soaked sand and the roar of a crowd hungry for a show.You’ve arrived with your six living brothers and your silent, shambling thrall, just in time for the midday games. The Arena Master stands by the gate, weighing your small band with a practiced, cynical eye."Three bouts today, Crownling? Bold. The pit doesn't care about your long walk—it only cares about how much blood you can spill before the sun sets."The Arena Challenge**Since you are limited to three brothers** per bout in the Arena, you must choose your champions carefully. The reward is high, but the risk of permanent injury is even higher.Current Champions Available:**Necola the Vatt'ghern** (The heavy hitter)Wilfried B** (Proven lethality)Hiyun** (Fresh, but capable)Kaetherlen E** (Likely still nursing wounds)Dauid** (Severely wounded from the last fight)Abanoub E Ibn Mansur**Note: The zombie Muyahid cannot enter the formal Arena bouts.*The crowd is already starting to chant. Which three brothers will you send into the pit for the first bout, and would you like me to describe the first group of opponents the Arena Master has lined up for you?**

When will he die?


---


## Gemini

The crowd in Ras Karim is roaring, though it's hard to tell if they're cheering for the carnage or laughing at the spectacle of Dauid** being dragged unconscious from the pit for the third time today.You’ve walked away with a staggering 4,790 crowns**, but the cost is written in the mangled wreck of a man that was once Dauid. With 7 permanent injuries**, he is less a warrior and more a collection of scar tissue held together by sheer spite and the Abyssal Mage's dark influence.The State of Dauid**"When will he die?"**
Technically, in Battle Brothers*, a brother only dies if they lose their last point of HP or fail a survival check upon being struck down. However, with 7 permanent injuries, his Maximum HP**, Melee Skill**, and Initiative** are likely so low that a stiff breeze could finish the job. He is a walking miracle of agony.His Current "Collection" likely includes:**Missing ear/eye, broken elbow, collapsed lung, mangled leg, etc.He is essentially a "living" training dummy at this point.The Aftermath**BoutOpponentsResultMVP1**7 WebknechtsVictoryNeCola** (6 Kills)2**7 WebknechtsVictoryNeCola** (5 Kills)3**4 NomadsVictoryNeCola** (4 Kills)

We looked at recruiting option at Ras Karim as we leave the areana. We picked up Imamaddin for 140. I think he have a slight potential to go beyond being a fodder.  ---  Juggler  Slathered in a musk of arrogance, Imamaddin strides around like everyone should know their name — throwing veiled insults as they go. Overly critical and thin skinned themselves, Imamaddin managed to get on the bad side of almost everyone they met, somehow without realising they were doing so at all. The day another performer rejected their "help" was the last straw. In just a few moments they destroyed all their work and set out to work in another profession, much to the relief of their fellow performers.


---


## Gemini

The arena crowd's cheers are still ringing in your ears as you meet Imamaddin** near the city gates. He’s currently explaining to a disinterested street urchin why the boy's juggling technique is "pedestrian at best."With his arrogant swagger and a tongue sharper than his daggers, he’s certainly colorful. As a Juggler**, he likely has high Initiative** and a decent Melee Skill** (ideal for hitting those small gaps in armor), but his "thin-skinned" nature might make his resolve a bit brittle when a real Orc Warrior starts screaming in his face.Still, at 140 crowns, he’s a bargain—especially compared to the gold you just squeezed out of the Arena Master.The Company Status: Day 17 Midday**Treasury:** ~5,500+ Crowns (A massive hoard for Day 17).New Blood:** Imamaddin (Juggler) - Testing his "potential."The Living Legend:** NeCola (15 kills in one day).The Medical Mystery:** Dauid (7 permanent injuries, currently being hauled in a cart).The Undead:** Zombie Muyahid (The silent shepherd).You have the gold to outfit this entire group in the finest mail and southern lamellar the marketplace has to offer. Or, perhaps, you want to find a surgeon to see if they can do anything for Dauid—though at this point, they might just suggest taxidermy.Would you like to visit the Ras Karim Blacksmith to spend your Arena winnings on high-tier armor, or shall we look for a contract to test Imamaddin's juggling skills in actual combat?**

We camped till morning, and then set off to Ka-Sabar


---


## Gemini

The trek toward Ka-Sabar** begins under the cool, fading light of the desert stars. The march is quiet, save for the rhythmic clanking of NeCola's** blood-stained gear and the wet, dragging footsteps of Zombie Muyahid**. In the back of the party, Dauid** groans with every bump in the road—a living map of every mistake the company has made so far.Imamaddin** spends the journey juggling a few stones and offering unsolicited "critiques" on how the others march, seemingly unaware that he’s one bad encounter away from joining Muyahid in the "undead fodder" category.Arrival at Ka-Sabar: Day 18 Midday**You crest the final dune to see the white stone of Ka-Sabar gleaming in the sun. This city is a hub of trade and often a source of lucrative contracts for those who don't mind getting their hands dirty for the Viziers.Current Situation:**Morale:** High (thanks to the massive Arena payday).Roster:** 7 Living, 1 Zombie, and the "Indestructible" Dauid.Objective:** Find new work or better steel.The city gates loom ahead. Shall we head straight to the Commander of the Guard to see what kind of trouble needs fixing, or do you want to browse the local Alchemist for some tools to keep Dauid’s remaining parts attached?**

We ran into a group of NOMADS  A band of desert raiders  preying on anyone trying to  cross the seas of sand. the band included  A Nomad Outlaw  A Barbarian Beastmaster  An Indebted  A Nomad Slinger  A Goblin Plunderer


---


## Gemini

The shimmering heat of the dunes gives way to the harsh reality of an ambush. This isn't just a pack of starving thieves; this is a motley, dangerous collection of desert scum. Seeing a Barbarian Beastmaster** teamed up with a Goblin Plunderer** suggests these nomads are more organized—or more desperate—than the usual lot.The Beastmaster likely has something nasty on a leash, and that Goblin won't fight fair.The Battlefield**The sand is loose, providing poor footing for your heavier bros. Your line stands ready: the Arena-god NeCola**, the arrogant newcomer Imamaddin**, and the shambling Zombie Muyahid** who acts as a meat-shield for the backline.Battle Lineup:**Frontline:** NeCola, Wilfried B, HiYun.Flanks/Support:** Imamaddin, Kaetherlen E, Abanoub.The "Distraction":** Zombie Muyahid and the battered Dauid.The Beastmaster lets out a piercing whistle, and the Goblin Plunderer cackles, readying a jagged blade.How shall we handle this, Commander? Will you let NeCola lead a direct charge to crush the Outlaw, or will you use Imamaddin’s agility to try and pick off the Slinger and Goblin before they can bleed you from a distance?**

The chaos in this world is no joke! the Outlaw turns out to be a demonic champion outlaw... It was a tough fight. Lucky for us we have me!

## Gemini

The desert is a cruel mistress, and she nearly claimed more than she gave today. A Demonic Champion Outlaw**? That is the stuff of tavern nightmares, yet NeCola the Vatt'ghern** continues his meteoric rise to legend, carving through the chaos with a staggering 678 damage dealt**.The "Chaos" you mentioned certainly took its toll on your front line's durability—or rather, its lack thereof.The Butcher's Bill**NeCola the Vatt'ghern:** Absolute dominance. Three more kills, and he didn't take a single scratch. He is becoming the undisputed anchor of this company.The "Fodder" Report:** * Dauid:** Struck down again*. He took 173 damage**, which should have killed a normal man three times over. He’s essentially a human jigsaw puzzle at this point.Zombie Muyahid:** Took a massive 178 damage**. Even in death, he continues to serve as an effective, if rotting, sponge for enemy steel.Imamaddin:** The arrogant juggler survived his first real taste of blood, though he spent more time watching NeCola work than contributing to the damage. He’ll surely claim he "orchestrated the positioning" later.Loot & Spoils**Defeating a Demonic Champion usually yields more than just a pat on the back. You likely recovered some cursed or high-quality gear from that Outlaw’s remains—something to make the 173 damage Dauid ate feel "worth it."You stand over the cooling corpses of the Beastmaster and his demonic ally. Ka-Sabar is close, but your party is dragging two nearly-destroyed bodies (one living, one dead) across the sand.Shall we limp into Ka-Sabar to sell the Champion's loot, or would you like to check Dauid's stats to see if he's gained an 8th permanent injury from this encounter?**

Muyahid met his ultimate death with his head minced


---


## Gemini

The desert finally claimed what was left of the shepherd. Muyahid Ibn Nusa**—a man who lost his sheep to a cliff and his life to an Orc—has finally had his journey ended. There is no stitching back a minced head; even the Abyssal Mage's dark arts have their limits when the vessel is ground into the sand.He served his final purpose well: standing in the way so that a legend like NeCola didn't have to.The Current Roster**The Survivors:** 7 Brothers (including the shell of a man known as Dauid).The Fallen:** Muyahid Ibn Nusa (Finally at peace, or at least no longer walking).The Legend:** NeCola** is surely eyeing some of that Champion loot after carrying the weight of the last four fights on his shoulders.Arrival at Ka-Sabar**You enter the city gates on Day 18**. The sun is high, and the smell of the city—charcoal, livestock, and sea salt—hits you. You have a purse heavy with arena gold and the trophies of a Demonic Champion.The "arrogant" Imamaddin** is already looking for a tavern to brag about the battle he barely participated in, while the rest of the men look to you for their next move.Shall we head to the local Blacksmith to see if they can repair the gear stripped from the Champion, or do you want to look for a replacement for the late Muyahid at the local volunteer stand?**

## User

More Nomads on the road...  # Group 1  NOMADS  A band of desert raiders  preying on anyone trying to  cross the seas of sand.  O A Necrosavant  O A Goblin Ambusher  O Some Indebted  # Group 2  Indebted  A Direwolf  Some Indebted  A Nomad Slinger  ---  We avoided 1 but charged at 2


---


## Gemini

Wise move. Facing a Necrosavant** and a Goblin Ambusher** in the same breath is a recipe for a wiped backline and a very short campaign—especially with a roster held together by stitches and arrogance.You veered away from the supernatural threat and set your sights on the second group. A Direwolf** and some Indebted** are much more manageable prey for NeCola** and the boys, though that Slinger** will surely try to add a few more dents to Dauid's** already ruined face.The Engagement: Group 2**The sand kicks up as your company closes the distance. The Direwolf howls, its ribs showing through patchy fur—it's hungry, but so are your men for more gold and XP. Imamaddin** readies his flail, no doubt preparing a witty remark for when the first Indebted falls.Battle Order:**The Wall:** NeCola and Wilfried B.The Flank:** Imamaddin (time to see if that "potential" is real).The "Target":** Dauid (serving as the inevitable magnet for the Slinger's stones).The clash is imminent. How did the fight go—did NeCola add a wolf-skin cloak to his collection, or did the Direwolf find a soft spot in your line?**


---


## User

The sad part is that the local army of Ka-Sabar decided to join us in the fight. We have only managed to kill 3 of the nomad group 2


---


## Gemini

There is nothing quite as frustrating as the "help" of a local militia stealing your glory—and more importantly, your experience points**. You do the hard work of tracking and engaging, only for the Ka-Sabar soldiers to swoop in like vultures to secure the kills and the loot.The Skirmish Results**CharacterKillsImpactNeCola**2Managed to carve through the Indebted before the army could intervene.Imamaddin**1Finally landed a blow! He’ll likely claim he saved the entire Ka-Sabar regiment.Dauid**0Survived! For Dauid, not being struck down is considered a flawless victory.

## User

It's day 18 night. We have entered Ka-Sabar. It's time to wrap up this session 6. DO up a summary


---


## Gemini

The sun sets over the white domes of Ka-Sabar**, bringing an end to a bloody and profitable stretch of days. From the gilded pits of the Arena to the sun-scorched dunes of the south, the company has grown rich in coin but lean in life.Session 6: Summary of the Sands**The Highs:**The Arena God:** NeCola the Vatt'ghern** has ascended to legendary status, single-handedly carrying three consecutive Arena bouts and ending the session with a massive kill count against a Demonic Champion.The War Chest:** You leave this session with a staggering treasury of over 5,000 crowns**, enough to buy the finest steel in the Southern Realms.Tactical Survival:** You successfully navigated a dangerous encounter with a Demonic Champion and wisely avoided a Necrosavant ambush that could have spelled the end.The Lows:**The Shepherd's End:** Muyahid Ibn Nusa** lived, died, rose as a zombie, and was finally "minced" into the sand. A short, tragic career.The "Support" Problem:** The local Ka-Sabar army's "help" robbed the company of valuable XP and glory during the final nomad skirmish.The "Miracle":**Dauid the Indestructible:** With 7 permanent injuries** and having been struck down in nearly every fight this session, Dauid remains technically alive. He is less a man and more a walking testament to the Abyssal Mage's stubbornness.Company Status: Day 18 (Night)**Roster:** 7 Brothers (6 Living, 1 Jigsaw Puzzle named Dauid).Newest Recruit:** Imamaddin** (Juggler), currently arrogant despite only one confirmed kill.Current Location:** Ka-Sabar.The fires of the desert city flicker as you prepare for the next chapter. You have the gold; now you just need the men to carry it.When you are ready for Session 7, shall we begin by browsing the elite recruits in the Ka-Sabar marketplace to finally give NeCola some competent help?**
