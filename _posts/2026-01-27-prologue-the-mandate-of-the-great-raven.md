I - [HiYun]({{ site.baseurl }}/HiYun)- was once the last son of a minor noble family, destined for a life of silent prayer within a distant abbey. That life died the moment I stepped into my grandfather’s secret library and laid hands upon the Raven Tome, a forbidden text that exerted a pull far stronger than any pious scripture.

For thirty years, I hunted shadows until a drunken tip regarding "*The Ravens Call*" led me to a hidden crypt with five hired men and my long-time companion, [NeCola]({{ site.baseurl }}/NeCola).

As we descended into the funerary chamber, the water began to rise, drowning the panicked daytalers. While they perished, I chose to submit to the water and embrace the abyss, triggering a ritual that would change the course of my existence.

I awoke under a full moon, no longer a scholar, but the "Chosen" of The [Changer]({{ site.baseurl }}/Changer) (the Great Raven)—a god of chaos.

The voice of the Great Raven now resonates in my mind with a singular, divine
mandate:

I must find the [The Usurper King]({{ site.baseurl }}/The%20Usurper%20King), a rogue demon lord who has betrayed the god of death, [Davkul]({{ site.baseurl }}/Davkul), and is currently mutating the land with a "Chaos Plague".

This world is gritty. [Human]({{ site.baseurl }}/Human) life is cheap and magic is a rare, terrifying force. To navigate this "Tainted World," I am not alone.

[NeCola]({{ site.baseurl }}/NeCola) was spared from the ritual due to our deep connection with each other.

She has chosen to undergo a horrific, Abyssal-stained [Trial of the Grasses]({{ site.baseurl }}/Trial%20of%20the%20Grasses) to become a [Vatt'ghern]({{ site.baseurl }}/Vatt%27ghern) (Witcher). She is my "Silver Sword," a moral fail-safe designed to slay me
should my growing chaotic power eventually erode my conscience.

Our path is dark, and the stakes are absolute: if I fall, the mandate fails. We must fight through a world of rising undead and mutated horrors, eventually descending the 19 floors of the Usurper’s Dungeon to confront the False God-King himself.
