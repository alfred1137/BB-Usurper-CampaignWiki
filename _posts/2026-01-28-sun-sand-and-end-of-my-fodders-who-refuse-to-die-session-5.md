title: "Sun, Sand, and End of My Fodders Who Refuse to Die (Session 5)"

The heat of the Southern deserts is not like the chill of the North; it does not bite, it suffocates. As we marched toward [Ras Karim](../wiki/locations/Ras%20Karim.md) on the afternoon of Day 13, the sun felt like a physical weight upon my green-tinged brow, a relentless eye of the Gilder that seemed intent on bleaching the very magic from my marrow. Behind me, my company—the Usurper’s Bane—trudged through the shifting dunes, their boots kicking up a fine, stinging dust that tasted of salt and ancient remains. We had traded the mud of [Stohl](../wiki/locations/Stohl.md) for this shimmering hellscape, and already the land had begun to prune the weak. [Arnulf](../wiki/characters/Arnulf.md) and [Evett](../wiki/characters/Evett.md) were gone, left to the scavengers, and my remaining frontline was little more than a collection of walking scars and bitter resentment.



    I often contemplate the nature of the 'fodder' I gather. To the Gilder-worshippers of these lands, life is a debt to be paid in service or blood, but to me, it is merely the insulation between my will and the blades of the world. I watched [Bardol](../wiki/characters/Bardol.md) F, a man who had been struck down more times than a tavern rug, and I felt a simmering irritation. Why does the Raven cling so tightly to such a broken vessel? Is there a grand design in his continued breathing, or is the [Changer](../wiki/characters/Changer.md) simply mocking my desire for a more efficient, undead vanguard? The desert provides a clarity that the damp forests of the North lack; here, you are either water or dust, and I am weary of leading men who insist on remains as the former when they have long since earned the status of the latter.



    ## The manhunter’s tithe and the gilded gates


    On the morning of Day 14, as the white spires of [Ras Karim](../wiki/locations/Ras%20Karim.md) flickered like a mirage on the horizon, we encountered a grim procession. A line of men in heavy iron chains was being driven through the sand by a manhunter whose ivory teeth flashed in a predatory grin. He claimed they were 'Indebted'—souls paying for the sins of their ancestors—but a voice cried out from the ranks, a sharp Northern accent that cut through the humid air. It was a sailor, a man named Frethold, who claimed he was no slave but a mariner captured by pirates. [Bardol](../wiki/characters/Bardol.md), with a moment of supernatural recognition that could only be a twist of the Raven’s own hand, identified the man as a former shipmate from winters past.



    The manhunter, perhaps sensing the Abyssal aura radiating from my form or seeing the yellow, predatory eyes of [NeCola](../wiki/characters/NeCola.md) shifting beneath her hood, chose the path of least resistance. He released Frethold, claiming the Gilder had ordained this meeting. I saw it differently: I saw a fresh body to replace the meat we had lost to the hyenas. Frethold joined our ranks, salt-crusted and sun-scorched, another fisherman destined to find the Abyss in the middle of a wasteland. We entered the gates of [Ras Karim](../wiki/locations/Ras%20Karim.md) shortly after, the air thick with the smell of roasting meats, exotic spices, and the copper tang of the nearby Arena.



    We had struck gold in this den of merchants; the sell prices were a tribute to the desperation of the South. But it was the Arena that called to me—a place where the transition from life to death is a spectator sport. I set our ambition: five victories in the pits to prove that the Usurper’s Bane was a name to be feared even in these gilded lands.



    ## The blood-stained sands of the Arena


    Our first bout was against two desert nomads for a purse of over fifteen hundred crowns. I stepped onto the hot sand alongside [NeCola](../wiki/characters/NeCola.md) and the seemingly immortal [Bardol](../wiki/characters/Bardol.md). [NeCola](../wiki/characters/NeCola.md) moved with a grace that transcended human limits, her [Vatt'ghern](../wiki/races/Vatt%27ghern.md) mutations allowing her to weave through the nomads' scimitars as if she were a ghost dancing in the wind. She dispatched them with a cold efficiency that left the crowd in a stunned silence before they erupted in a roar of bloodlust. [Bardol](../wiki/characters/Bardol.md), true to his curse, held the line with a frantic, desperate effort, absorbing a blow that would have decapitated a lesser man. He was struck down, his blood painting the sand, yet he refused to yield his final breath.



    The second match was a pit of serpents. Three great snakes coiled and hissed, their venomous fangs glinting in the sun. It was an easy slaughter for [NeCola](../wiki/characters/NeCola.md), who severed their heads before they could strike, while [Bardol](../wiki/characters/Bardol.md) once again acted as the target, surviving yet another mauling that defied the laws of anatomy. By the third match, another trio of nomads, I found myself whispering to the fisherman as we entered the gate: "[Bardol](../wiki/characters/Bardol.md), try not to survive this one, yes?". But the Raven is a fickle god; the nomads broke against us, and [Bardol](../wiki/characters/Bardol.md) was dragged from the arena floor, mangled and unconscious, yet still stubbornly, irritatingly alive.



    Before leaving the city, I recruited [Abanoub Ibn Mansur](../wiki/characters/Abanoub%20Ibn%20Mansur.md), a man born into debt whose primary allegiance was to a freedom he had never tasted. He was an investment in pure potential—and a salary-free one at that. I looked at him and saw a man who would either find his liberty or his grave under my banner, and I cared little which came first. We departed [Ras Karim](../wiki/locations/Ras%20Karim.md) toward Makan Muqadas, the holy city, but the desert had one final, cruel joke to play on our journey.



    ## The necromancer’s harvest: a final farewell


    The march to [Makan Muqadas](../wiki/locations/Makan Muqadas.md) was interrupted by the stench of old rot that even the sun could not burn away. A Necromancer, flanked by a Fallen Hero in rusted plate and an Embalmed Slave, blocked our path. This was no arena show; this was a struggle for the very souls of my company. The fight lasted seven rounds of absolute carnage. [NeCola](../wiki/characters/NeCola.md) was a vision of death, her silver blade dealing a staggering amount of damage as she kept the Fallen Hero occupied, her signs crackling in the dry air. I unleashed the Abyssal energies I had been nurturing, my Twisted Shock arcing through the air to wither the Necromancer’s focus.



    But the cost was the end of an era. The "Immortals" of my frontline—the men who had survived the Northern wastes and the Geist's scream—finally reached their limit. Frethold, the sailor we had just rescued, was the first to fall. Then [Jan](../wiki/characters/Jan.md) the Bright, whose luck finally ran dry in a spray of gore. And finally, [Bardol](../wiki/characters/Bardol.md) F, the man who had cheated death a dozen times, was torn apart by the Embalmed Slave. I watched them fall, and for a moment, the desert was silent save for the buzzing of flies. [Wilfried](../wiki/characters/Wilfried.md) B, my spectral warrior, stood over the bodies and asked what should be done. I did not hesitate. "Loot the bodies," I commanded, my voice like the dry wind. "Leave the dead to the birds".



    We reached the gates of Makan Muqadas by mid-day on Day 15. We had entered the desert as a company of survivors; we entered the holy city as a company of killers, stripped of our dead weight and our illusions. The Usurper’s shadow is close now, and while the Gilder’s followers pray for salvation, I am preparing to show them that in the Abyss, there is no such thing as debt—only the finality of the grave.

    ## Session wrap


    The journey saw several key encounters: we claimed the sailor Frethold from a Southern slaver; secured three of the five arena victories necessary for my current ambition in [Ras Karim](../wiki/locations/Ras%20Karim.md); and were ambushed by a Necromancer’s company, which, despite our victory, collapsed our entire old frontline. We even assisted the city-state scouts against an Icy Golem and Possessed Raiders outside Makan Muqadas itself.


    **[NeCola](../wiki/characters/NeCola.md)**, the [Vatt'ghern](../wiki/races/Vatt%27ghern.md), was dominant across every engagement, single-handedly carrying the offense. **[HiYun](../wiki/characters/HiYun.md)**, my Abyssal [Mage](../wiki/races/Mage.md), secured a kill against the Necromancer's core and provided vital ranged support. **[Abanoub Ibn Mansur](../wiki/characters/Abanoub%20Ibn%20Mansur.md)** survived his debut despite taking a brutal beating that nearly ended him early.


    The heavy cost was paid by the veterans, the so-called "Immortals." [character:8779130], [Jan](../wiki/characters/Jan.md) the bright, and finally [Bardol](../wiki/characters/Bardol.md)were all killed in action. Their deaths have stripped the roster of fodder, leaving a lean core of high-talent fighters ([NeCola](../wiki/characters/NeCola.md), [Wilfried](../wiki/characters/Wilfried.md), [HiYun](../wiki/characters/HiYun.md)). But the treasury has seen significant growth from arena payouts and successful trade in [Ras Karim](../wiki/locations/Ras%20Karim.md), proving the risks were worthwhile.



    With the "Immortals" dead and our pockets full of Gilder gold, we stand at the heart of Southern faith in Makan Muqadas. The ambition is three-fifths complete, and the company is gaining serious notoriety in these lands. But as the dead rise in the dunes and the possessed wander the outskirts, I wonder: did the Raven allow my veterans to die to make room for something far more monstrous?
