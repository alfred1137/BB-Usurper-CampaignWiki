This campaign series and the featured gameplay mechanics are built upon the foundations provided by the following developers and modding teams.



    
        ### Overhype Studios (Battle Brothers)

        The core tactical experience, brutal atmosphere, and low-fantasy setting are the original work of Overhype Studios. Their mastery of turn-based mercenary management serves as the essential canvas for this entire narrative.

        ### The Legends Team (Legends Mod)

        The Legends Mod provides the comprehensive overhaul required for this campaign's complexity. By introducing layered armor, dynamic perk trees, and expanded world mechanics, this team has fundamentally evolved the depth of the base game.

        ### Abyss & Lone Mind (Rise of the Usurper - RotU)

        The occult narrative, the 19-floor Usurper Dungeon, and the Abyssal [Mage](../wiki/races/Mage.md) origin are credited to the RotU team. Their work introduces the high-stakes "Tainted World" mechanics and the divine influence of the Great Raven and [Davkul](../wiki/characters/Davkul.md).

        ### TheBlueTemplar (Path of [Vatt'ghern](../wiki/races/Vatt%27ghern.md) - PoV)

        The Witcher-inspired mutations and specialized companion origins (such as [NeCola](../wiki/characters/NeCola.md)) are powered by the PoV mod. This project integrates the alchemical [Trial of the Grasses](../wiki/quests/Trial%20of%20the%20Grasses.md) and [Vatt'ghern](../wiki/races/Vatt%27ghern.md) backgrounds as a specialized submod of Legends.
