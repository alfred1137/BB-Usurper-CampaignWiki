I - [HiYun](../wiki/characters/HiYun.md)- was once the last son of a minor noble family, destined for a life of
    silent prayer within a distant abbey. That life died the moment I stepped
    into my grandfather’s secret library and laid hands upon the Raven Tome, a forbidden text that exerted a pull far stronger than any pious
    scripture.




  For thirty years, I hunted shadows until a drunken tip
    regarding "The Ravens Call" led me to a hidden crypt with five hired men and my long-time
    companion, [NeCola](../wiki/characters/NeCola.md).

  As we descended into the funerary chamber, the water began to rise, drowning
  the panicked daytalers. While they perished, I chose to submit to the water and embrace the abyss, triggering a ritual that would change the course of my existence.




  I awoke under a full moon, no longer a scholar, but the "Chosen" of The [Changer](../wiki/characters/Changer.md) (the Great Raven)—a god of chaos.

  The voice of the Great Raven now resonates in my mind with a singular, divine
  mandate:




  I must find the [The Usurper King](../wiki/characters/The%20Usurper%20King.md), a rogue demon lord who has
  betrayed the god of death, [Davkul](../wiki/characters/Davkul.md), and is currently mutating the land with a "Chaos Plague".




  This world is gritty. [Human](../wiki/races/Human.md) life is cheap and magic is a rare, terrifying
  force. To navigate this "Tainted World," I am not alone.
  [NeCola](../wiki/characters/NeCola.md) was spared from the ritual due to our deep connection with each other.




  She has chosen to undergo a horrific, Abyssal-stained [Trial of the Grasses](../wiki/quests/Trial%20of%20the%20Grasses.md) to become a
  [Vatt'ghern](../wiki/races/Vatt'ghern.md)
  (Witcher). She is my "Silver Sword," a moral fail-safe designed to slay me
  should my growing chaotic power eventually erode my conscience.

  Our path is dark, and the stakes are absolute: if I fall, the mandate fails.
  We must fight through a world of rising undead and mutated horrors, eventually
  descending the 19 floors of the Usurper’s Dungeon to confront the False God-King himself.
