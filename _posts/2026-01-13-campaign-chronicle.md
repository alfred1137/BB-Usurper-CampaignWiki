**Type**: Story

## Introduction 


  The **Rise of the Usurper (RotU)** and **Path of the Vett'ghern ****(PoV)** story follows the **Abyssal [Mage](../wiki/races/Mage.md)**, [HiYun](../wiki/characters/HiYun.md), a noble-born scholar who discovered forbidden knowledge in a secret
    library. After surviving a ritual in a hidden crypt described in the **Raven Tome**, he becomes the "Chosen" of **The **[Changer](../wiki/characters/Changer.md) (the Great Raven), a god of chaos.




  * 
    **The Divine Mandate:** The [Mage](../wiki/races/Mage.md) is tasked with hunting down
    the **Usurper**, a rogue demon lord who has betrayed the god of
    death ([Davkul](../wiki/characters/Davkul.md)) and is spreading a **"Chaos Plague"** and
    mutating the world.
  
  * 
    **The [Vatt'ghern](../wiki/races/Vatt%27ghern.md) Companion:** He is accompanied by
    [NeCola](../wiki/characters/NeCola.md)****, who underwent a painful, "Abyssal-stained"
    **[Trial of the Grasses](../wiki/quests/Trial%20of%20the%20Grasses.md)** to become a Witcher ([Vatt'ghern](../wiki/races/Vatt%27ghern.md)). She
    serves as a **moral fail-safe**, prepared to slay the [Mage](../wiki/races/Mage.md) if
    his dark powers eventually erode his conscience.
  
  * 
    **The Conflict:** The world is caught in an "eternal chess war"
    between the ruinous powers of chaos and death, manifesting through mortals
    who receive blessings or demonic corruption.
  
  * 
    **The Ultimate Goal:** The story culminates in a descent into
    the **[Usurper's Dungeon](../wiki/locations/Usurper's%20Dungeon.md)**, a 19-floor stronghold where the company must confront the
    [The Usurper King](../wiki/characters/The%20Usurper%20King.md)
    to end his reign of mutations and undeath.
