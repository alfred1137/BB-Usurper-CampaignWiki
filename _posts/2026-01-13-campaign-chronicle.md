## Introduction

 The **Rise of the Usurper (RotU)** and **Path of the Vett'ghern****(PoV)** story follows the **Abyssal [Mage]({{ site.baseurl }}/Mage)**, [HiYun]({{ site.baseurl }}/HiYun), a noble-born scholar who discovered forbidden knowledge in a secret library. After surviving a ritual in a hidden crypt described in the **Raven Tome**, he becomes the "Chosen" of **The**[Changer]({{ site.baseurl }}/Changer) (the Great Raven), a god of chaos.

**The Divine Mandate:** The [Mage]({{ site.baseurl }}/Mage) is tasked with hunting down the **Usurper**, a rogue demon lord who has betrayed the god of death ([Davkul]({{ site.baseurl }}/Davkul)) and is spreading a **"Chaos Plague"** and mutating the world.
  
**The [Vatt'ghern]({{ site.baseurl }}/Vatt%27ghern) Companion:** He is accompanied by [NeCola]({{ site.baseurl }}/NeCola), who underwent a painful, "Abyssal-stained" [Trial of the Grasses]({{ site.baseurl }}/Trial%20of%20the%20Grasses) to become a Witcher ([Vatt'ghern]({{ site.baseurl }}/Vatt%27ghern)). She serves as a **moral fail-safe**, prepared to slay the [Mage]({{ site.baseurl }}/Mage) if his dark powers eventually erode his conscience.

**The Conflict:** The world is caught in an "eternal chess war" between the ruinous powers of chaos and death, manifesting through mortals who receive blessings or demonic corruption.
  
**The Ultimate Goal:** The story culminates in a descent into the [Usurper's Dungeon]({{ site.baseurl }}/Usurper%27s%20Dungeon), a 19-floor stronghold where the company must confront the [The Usurper King]({{ site.baseurl }}/The%20Usurper%20King) to end his reign of mutations and undeath.

## Credits

This campaign series and the featured gameplay mechanics are built upon the foundations provided by the following developers and modding teams.

### Overhype Studios (Battle Brothers)

The core tactical experience, brutal atmosphere, and low-fantasy setting are the original work of Overhype Studios. Their mastery of turn-based mercenary management serves as the essential canvas for this entire narrative.

* [Official Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/365360/Battle_Brothers/)

### The Legends Team (Legends Mod)

The Legends Mod provides the comprehensive overhaul required for this campaign's complexity. By introducing layered armor, dynamic perk trees, and expanded world mechanics, this team has fundamentally evolved the depth of the base game.

### Abyss & Lone Mind (Rise of the Usurper - RotU)

The occult narrative, the 19-floor Usurper Dungeon, and the Abyssal [Mage]({{ site.baseurl }}/Mage) origin are credited to the RotU team. Their work introduces the high-stakes "Tainted World" mechanics and the divine influence of the Great Raven and [Davkul]({{ site.baseurl }}/Davkul).

### TheBlueTemplar (Path of Vatt'ghern - PoV)

The Witcher-inspired mutations and specialized companion origins (such as [NeCola]({{ site.baseurl }}/NeCola)) are powered by the PoV mod. This project integrates the alchemical [Trial of the Grasses]({{ site.baseurl }}/Trial%20of%20the%20Grasses) and [Vatt'ghern]({{ site.baseurl }}/Vatt%27ghern) backgrounds as a specialized submod of Legends.
