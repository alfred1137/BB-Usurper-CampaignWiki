**Type**: Story

## Introduction

The **Rise of the Usurper (RotU)** and **Path of the Vett'ghern \*\***(PoV)** story follows the **Abyssal Mage**, [[HiYun]], a noble-born scholar who discovered forbidden knowledge in a secret
library. After surviving a ritual in a hidden crypt described in the **Raven Tome**, he becomes the "Chosen" of **The \*\*[[Changer]] (the Great Raven), a god of chaos.

- **The Divine Mandate:** The Mage is tasked with hunting down
  the **Usurper**, a rogue demon lord who has betrayed the god of
  death (Davkul) and is spreading a **"Chaos Plague"** and
  mutating the world.

- **The Vatt'ghern Companion:** He is accompanied by
  [[NeCola]]\***\*, who underwent a painful, "Abyssal-stained"
  **Trial of the Grasses** to become a Witcher (Vatt'ghern). She
  serves as a **moral fail-safe\*\*, prepared to slay the Mage if
  his dark powers eventually erode his conscience.

- **The Conflict:** The world is caught in an "eternal chess war"
  between the ruinous powers of chaos and death, manifesting through mortals
  who receive blessings or demonic corruption.

- **The Ultimate Goal:** The story culminates in a descent into
  the **[[Usurper's Dungeon]]**, a 19-floor stronghold where the company must confront the
  [[The Usurper King]]
  to end his reign of mutations and undeath.
