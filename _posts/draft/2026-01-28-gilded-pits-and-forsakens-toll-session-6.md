# Blood-soaked Sand around Makan Muqadas

    The white domes of Makan Muqadas—a holy city that felt more like a tomb to my Northern sensibilities—shimmered under the Gilder’s sun like the bleached skulls of giants. We had left the remains of [Bardol]({{ site.baseurl }}/Bardol) and [Jan]({{ site.baseurl }}/Jan) to the carrion birds, their boasted "immortality" proving only a temporary delay to the Raven’s hunger. I stood at the threshold of the Great Arena, the air thick with the cloying scent of frankincense, roasted meats, and the copper tang of fresh blood. My company, the Usurper's Bane, was now a lean, predatory thing—a collection of spectral remnants and mutated killers bound by my Abyssal will. We had three victories in the pits already; ambition demanded two more, and the desert was eager to provide the victims.



    I looked at the white domes of Makan Muqadas and felt nothing but the hollow chill of the Raven’s gaze. I told myself the loss of [Bardol]({{ site.baseurl }}/Bardol) and the others was not a tragedy, but merely a necessary subtraction of inefficient parts from a grand machine. Yet, a nagging sensation persists, a sliver of the monk I was meant to be, whispering that I am becoming the very disaster I was sent to stop. Does the [Changer]({{ site.baseurl }}/Changer) care for the blood we spill, or is the Usurper merely a reflection of my own descent? My noble lineage is a dust-choked memory now, replaced by the copper tang of desert air and the sight of my men becoming monsters. I wonder if the Azure Lord mocks me, or if the "Indebted" like Abanoub are the only ones truly free in this world. They owe only their lives; I owe my soul to a void that never stops screaming for more. To build a legend, one must first bury the man.



    ## The Sand’s Final Tithe


    The heat was a physical weight, a hammer-blow from the Gilder that made the air wobble over the arena floor. Our fourth bout was a grizzly affair against a pair of Southern Gladiators, men who moved with the grace of scorpions and the arrogance of kings. I watched from the rear, my green-tinged fingers weaving the threads of the Abyss into a Twisted Shock that arced across the sand. [NeCola]({{ site.baseurl }}/NeCola), her yellow [Vatt'ghern]({{ site.baseurl }}/Vatt%27ghern) eyes focused, moved with unnatural clarity, her blade finding the gap in a gladiator’s mail with the precision of a surgeon. The crowd roared, a sound like crashing waves, as the man slumped into the dust, his blood instantly boiling in the midday heat.



    The final match was a necessary test of iron and resolve. We faced three desert nomads, their faces masked by indigo veils, their movements synchronized and deadly. Abanoub, the Indebted who sought freedom in the spray of gore, held the center. He fought with frantic energy, his shield absorbing blows that should have shattered a lesser man’s arm. [Wilfried]({{ site.baseurl }}/Wilfried) B, our spectral Ancestral [Vatt'ghern]({{ site.baseurl }}/Vatt%27ghern), stood beside him—a pale blue light in the shimmering haze that seemed to ignore the heat entirely. He struck with his spectral edge, the nomads’ steel passing through him as if he were nothing but a bad memory. When the last nomad fell, the circuit was ours. We were no longer just mercenaries; we were the undisputed masters of [Ras Karim]({{ site.baseurl }}/Ras%20Karim).



    As we gathered our spoils, a new figure approached the company under the flickering torchlight of the city gates—a creature that made even the battle-hardened Conscripts recoil. He was an Arachnid Warped Warrior, his skin covered in a hard, chitinous shell that pulsed with an unnatural life. He claimed to have been "changed" by the same void that answered my call, his funnel-web eyes reflecting a vision that saw humans only as prey. I welcomed him into the Bane. In this world of rising dead and demon lords, a man with the sting of a redback is a tool I cannot afford to ignore.



    ## The Siege of the Ruined Gate


    We departed Makan Muqadas on Day 16, heading back toward the northern wastes where the Usurper’s shadow grew longest. The journey was a grueling march across the brutal desert, where every oasis felt like a trap and every vulture felt like a spy. By Day 17, the terrain shifted into a jagged wasteland of cracked earth and dry scrub. It was here that we encountered the first true proof of our progress: The Forsaken. These were not mere bandits; they were heavy-armored monstrosities, mutated to the point of total insanity, their humanity lost to the very warp I sought to command.



    The scouts signaled a halt. Ahead, near a ruined caravanserai, a Forsaken Champion stood amidst a pile of slaughtered merchants. He was a hulking brute, his armor fused to his skin by pulsating, night-black veins—the tell-tale mark of a demon-cursed weapon. Around him stood his minions, men whose bodies had sprouted extra limbs or hardened into bone-crusted shells. The air around them crackled with the same Abyssal Fire I had used to stabilize [NeCola]({{ site.baseurl }}/NeCola). This was the Usurper’s rising power made flesh, a challenge meant to break us.



    I felt the men hesitate. Even [Wilfried]({{ site.baseurl }}/Wilfried)'s spectral glow seemed to dim in the presence of such raw, mutated malice. I stepped to the front of the line, my staff thumping against the parched earth. "They are but meat," I snarled, the Raven's voice echoing in the hollows of my skull. "And we are the butcher." I channeled the Abyss, my Sign Intensity surging as I prepared to unleash the forbidden magic of the [Vatt'ghern]({{ site.baseurl }}/Vatt%27ghern). The Forsaken leader let out a roar that was more animal than man, his mutated lungs pushing out a cloud of foul, necrotizing steam as he charged.



    ## The Ruined Gate


    The combat was swift and vicious. [NeCola]({{ site.baseurl }}/NeCola) opened the fight by casting the Yrden sign; purple glyphs flared on the ground, trapping the Forsaken in a field of sluggish time that hampered their mutated speed. The Forsaken Champion, however, ignored the trap, his demon-cursed axe descending in a vertical arc. Abanoub raised his shield, but the strike was so overwhelming he fumbled the defense, his boots slipping in the dry sand as he fell backward in an embarrassing sprawl. The Champion raised his weapon for the killing blow, but I intervened, casting a Raven Bolt of Change that ignored his heavy plate and sizzled through his mutated heart.



    [Wilfried]({{ site.baseurl }}/Wilfried) B took advantage of the opening, his spectral blades weaving through the gaps in the Forsaken's iron skin. He moved with supernatural clarity, guided by the Azure Lord toward the enemy's softest corruption. Beside him, our new Arachnid recruit unleashed his Redback Sting, injecting a corrosive venom into the Forsaken's open wounds. The mutated warriors fought with mindless rage, their dark power letting them absorb far more punishment than they deserved, but they were no match for the combined might of our [Vatt'ghern]({{ site.baseurl }}/Vatt%27ghern) signs and Abyssal shocks.



    The climax arrived when [NeCola]({{ site.baseurl }}/NeCola) unleashed the Bront sign. Chain lightning erupted from her fingertips, jumping from the Champion to his mutated retinue in a blinding flash of blue-white energy that ignored their armor entirely. The Forsaken broke. Their iron will shattered under the weight of the Azure Lord's wrath. The Champion was the last to fall, his body dissolving into a puddle of black ichor and mutated reagents that hissed against the desert sand. We stood victorious amidst the ruin, the silence of the desert returning as the last of the lightning faded.



    ## The Butcher’s Resolve


    We gathered the remains—the special mutagens and demon-stained steel that would be the foundation for our next transformation. The Forsaken Champion’s head was a trophy that would earn us a king's ransom in the North, but the true prize was realizing the Usurper's influence was spreading faster than my texts had predicted. We had survived the long road through the South, but the path back to the Raven’s Watch would be paved with the bodies of those who dared to stand in the path of the [Changer]({{ site.baseurl }}/Changer).



    As we marched away from the ruined caravanserai, the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the desert in the bruised purples and blacks of our own banner. My company was battered, our armor dented and our spirits frayed, but we were evolving. I looked at Abanoub, nursing a bruised shoulder, and at the Arachnid Warrior, cleaning his mandibles with indifferent efficiency. We were becoming the very nightmare the world feared—a gathering of the maimed and the mutated, marching under the mandate of a god of void. [The Usurper King]({{ site.baseurl }}/The%20Usurper%20King) sits on his obsidian throne, but he does not see the wave of carrion-flies I am bringing to his gates.

    ### **Session Wrap**


    The week concluded with the successful completion of the five required arena fights in Makan Muqadas, solidifying our reputation and netting significant coin. More importantly, we recruited the Arachnid Warped Warrior, bringing a potent new source of poison and chitinous defense to the Bane.



    The true test came in the deep desert when we faced The Forsaken. These heavy-armored foes confirmed that the "Demonic Chaos" curse is spreading rapidly beyond the Northern Barbarians. The fighting was fierce. [NeCola]({{ site.baseurl }}/NeCola)'s new Tier 3 Offense Signs proved devastating, scoring several kills through massive area-of-effect damage. [Wilfried]({{ site.baseurl }}/Wilfried) B performed flawlessly, sustaining zero damage while acting as our spectral anchor. My own Abyssal Shocks were essential for bypassing the Champion’s heavily fused armor, though Abanoub suffered a critical strike early on, taking heavy damage before I could intervene.



    We are now wealthy enough to return to the North and purchase new, high-grade equipment. However, as we crest the dunes heading north, the [Vatt'ghern]({{ site.baseurl }}/Vatt%27ghern) Medallion doesn't just hum—it screams. Something massive is moving in the shifting sands, a creature—perhaps a Flesh Golem or a Lindwurm—drawn by the potent scent of our lightning. We have gained new power, but this power has finally caught the eye of something far larger than the Forsaken.
