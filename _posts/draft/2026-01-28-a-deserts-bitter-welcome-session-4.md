The banner of the Usurper’s Bane hung limp in the stagnant air of Ravens' Town, its black and purple fabric absorbing the pale northern light like a sponge for shadows. We had survived the North’s bite and the screams of the Geists, but the cost was etched into the jagged scars and hollow eyes of my men. I stood amidst the gloom, feeling the Abyssal energy within me coil restlessly. My company was a collection of the broken men held together by the Raven’s Blessing and my own iron will. Yet, as I looked at the mangled trio of fishermen and the zombified remains of Evett, I knew that for the journey ahead, I needed more than just durable meat. I needed a legend.

    The pursuit of the Usurper King is a heavy burden, one that requires a detachment from pity and mercy. I find myself staring at the fishermen, convinced that the Raven’s laughter is the only thing keeping them upright. Is this my destiny? To lead a parade of corpses through the mud of the world? I am the last son of a noble house, a scholar of the forbidden, yet I spend my days bartering for souls in a town that smells of wet wool and despair. The Usurper sits on his throne, but he is a shadow compared to the void I am prepared to unleash. If I must fill my roster with ghosts to reach him, then the graveyard will be my recruitment hall.



    ## The spectral vanguard and the carrion feast

    In the heart of Ravens' Town, I found him. [character:8779123] was a memory, clad in the iron of a previous life—an Ancestral Vatt'ghern whose singular ambition was such that the Azure Lord could not claim his soul for the afterlife. He was a spectral entity of blue and cyan light, his presence causing the air to crackle with frost. I paid **five thousand crowns** for his compact—a king’s ransom for a ghost. The townspeople crossed themselves as we departed. Wilfried’s spectral boots made no sound on the cobblestones, a sharp contrast to the wet, rhythmic thumping of my undead thrall, **Arnulf**.



    The road leading south toward Stohl was quickly interrupted by the stench of rot. A pack of Nachzehrers—vile eaters of remains—lunged from the brush, their distended bellies dragging in the dirt. I didn't even bother to raise my staff. **NeCola** moved with indifference, her slitted eyes tracking the ghouls. The fight was a surgical slaughter that lasted mere seconds. **Bardol**, the thrice-struck fisherman, fought with supernatural clarity, his spear finding the throat of a beast with precision impossible for a man with his injuries. However, the victory was soured; Arnulf, my tireless zombie, was caught in a frenzied mauling that left him shredded. I watched him shamble back into line, his undead flesh weeping black ichor.



    This world is sustained by consuming the remains of its failures. We eat the remains of our enemies to grow stronger; we loot the dead to pay for the living. I recruited a refugee named **Dauid** on the march—a man who had seen his village burned to ash and had nothing left but his skin. I saw the fear in his eyes when he looked at Wilfried, but he joined nonetheless. He is another vessel, another piece of fodder to be thrown into the gears of my conquest. I wonder if he realizes that his ‘survival’ is merely a temporary lease granted by my curiosity.



    ## The burning sands of Ka-Sabar

    By the midday of Day 13, the biting winds of the North were a distant memory, replaced by the salt-heavy, sweltering heat of the Southern City-States. We had paid the gold to sail across the sea, trading the mud of Stohl for the shimmering, deceptive sands of Ka-Sabar. The sudden change felt brutal. The Gilder-worshipping southerners looked at my green skin and spectral warriors with dread and suspicion. Ka-Sabar itself was a disappointment; the economy was stagnant, and the Viziers were too busy counting their gold to offer a contract worthy of the Usurper's Bane.



    We pushed onward toward Ras Karim, the sun a relentless hammer beating down on the armor of my men. The heat was an enemy we could not strike. I watched as Dauid and the other fodder struggled, their breath coming in ragged gasps. I grew cold with annoyance. These men were becoming soft under the gaze of the Gilder. To break the dull monotony, I found a target in the dunes: a lone hyena, a scavenger that had been tailing us for miles. I ordered the company to halt. I wanted entertainment, a distraction.



    "Dance for me," I commanded, gesturing toward the beast. "Let us see how many bites the 'blessed' can dodge before the sand drinks." It was a cruel whim, perhaps, but a Mage must occasionally test the limits of his tools. The hyena was a blur of tan fur and snapping jaws. I expected a quick execution, but the desert has a way of humbling the arrogant. The beast moved with a speed that defied its size, its teeth finding the gaps in the men's concentration. The "dance" was a bloody massacre of the weak, a testament to the fragility of those who rely on luck rather than skill.



    ## The butcher's bill in the dunes

    The fight lasted five agonizing rounds. What I had intended as training became a charnel house. Arnulf, the faithful zombie who had survived the Northern Champion and the Geists, was finally undone. The hyena’s jaws closed around his throat, and for the first time, the zombie did not rise. Evett the Rabbit, another of my zombified vanguard, was shredded into unrecognisable ribbons of meat. They met their final death in the most ignoble of ways—at the teeth of a common scavenger. Bardol, Dauid, and Jan the Bright were struck down, their bodies a collection of fresh, permanent injuries that would haunt them for the rest of their short lives.



    The carnage left me hollow, not for the men, but for the waste of resources. Arnulf had been a reliable anvil, a tireless wall of meat that required no food. To lose him to a hyena felt like a personal insult from the Raven. I look at the survivors, Bardol and the others, and I see the marks of the desert. They are "injury collectors" now, barely held together by bandages and the lingering traces of my magic. The Usurper King’s shadow looms larger as my frontline crumbles into the sand.



    We looted the bodies of our own brothers, stripping the rusted mail and bloodied leather from the remains of Arnulf and Evett. "Leave the dead to the birds," I ordered, my voice as dry as the dunes. We left them for the crows and the vultures, a grim offering to the desert that had already taken so much. NeCola and Wilfried stood by in silence, their eyes fixed on the horizon where the spires of Ras Karim flickered like a mirage. They are the only pillars of strength left in a line that is rapidly becoming a collection of cripples.



    ## Resolution and the road to Ras Karim

    The desert is a cruel mistress, and she has already begun to prune the weak. We are a leaner company now, stripped of our illusions and our most durable thralls. We limp toward Ras Karim, a parade of the maimed led by a Mage who has forgotten the meaning of mercy. The **10,000 crowns** in my purse feel heavier now, a weight that reminds me of the cost of every victory and the inevitable price of my ultimate goal.



    The Usurper is waiting, but the desert was the first wall I had to breach. I look at Dauid, the survivor who is now a broken man, and I wonder who will be the next to feed the birds. The Raven God is laughing, I can hear it in the wind that howls across the dunes. Next, we shall enter the Arena of Ras Karim, where blood is the only currency that matters. Will my "injury collectors" find glory in the pits, or will the desert finish what the hyena started?

    ## Session Wrap

- The company has transitioned from the North to the Southern City-States via Stohl._ Heavy investment in Wilfried (5,000 crowns) and travel (360 crowns)._ The loss of two zombified frontliners has significantly weakened the company's defensive capabilities.

  ### Encounters:

        * **The Ravens' Town Pact:** Recruited Wilfried, an Ancestral Vatt'ghern spectral entity.
        * **The Nachzehrer Harvest:** A 3-round victory outside Ravens' Town. Arnulf sustained 66 HP damage.
        * **The Hyena's Dance:** A disastrous encounter resulting in the final deaths of two veteran thralls.

  ### Combat Records:

        * NeCola (Vatt'ghern): 2 Kills. Remains the company's primary dealer of death.
        * Wilfried B (Vatgern): Sustained 0 damage in his debut. A stable spectral anchor.
        * Bardol F: Sustained 123 damage. Now a permanent injury collector.
        * Arnulf F (Zombie): KIA. Met final death in the dunes.
        * Evett E (Zombie): KIA. Met final death in the dunes.

  The Usurper's Bane reaches Ras Karim with a shattered line. With the Arena looming, will the "indestructible" survivors find their end in the pits, or will a new source of power emerge from the southern heat?
