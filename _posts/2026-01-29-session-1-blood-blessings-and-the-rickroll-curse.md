**Type**: Session

The Abyss is not merely a place; it is a hunger. It moved within my marrow as
  I ([HiYun](../wiki/characters/HiYun.md) ) watched
  [NeCola](../wiki/characters/NeCola.md)
  convulse upon the frost-nipped grass outside the village of
  [Stohl](../wiki/locations/Stohl.md).
  [Trial of the Grasses](../wiki/quests/Trial%20of%20the%20Grasses.md) had not been kind.




  Her hair, once a hallmark of her vigor, was matted against a brow slick with
  the cold sweat of a rewiring physiology. I stood over her, my own skin—a hue
  of sickly, arcane green—casting a ghastly pallor in the moonlight.




  She had chosen this path to become a
  [Vatt'ghern](../wiki/races/Vatt'ghern.md), a silver sword meant to kill the monster I might become. But for now, she
  was a liability, a flickering flame in a world of encroaching shadows. She is
  extremely weak from the horrific transformation.

  The mission the Great Raven—the
  [Changer](../wiki/characters/Changer.md)—had bestowed upon me was absolute: find the
  [The Usurper King](../wiki/characters/The%20Usurper%20King.md), that demon lord who mimics godhood, and determine if he serves the Void or
  the flaccid god of death. To reach a king, one needs more than a sick guardian
  and a mage with rotting face. At least, we need a wall of meat.




## The Mark of the [Changer](../wiki/characters/Changer.md)



  [Stohl](../wiki/locations/Stohl.md)
  smelled of old fish and failed ambitions. I found them in the town square:
  three fishermen, their hands calloused by salt-worn ropes and their eyes
  vacant with the aimless despair of the poor.




  For six hundred crowns,
  [Arnulf](../wiki/characters/Arnulf.md), [Bardol](../wiki/characters/Bardol.md) and
  [Ingald](../wiki/characters/Ingald.md)
  agreed to put down their fishing nets for an adventure. I looked into their
  mundane souls and felt the Raven stir. With a flick of my fingers, I bestowed
  the Raven’s Blessing upon two of them.

  They felt it as a surge of unnatural vigor, a warmth in their veins they
  mistook for hope. I knew it for what it truly was: a mark of durability, meant
  only to keep the meat fresh longer for the butcher’s blade.





  Why do they follow so easily? I wondered as we walk across town. Do they not
  smell the ozone and grave-dust that clings to my robes? They are but
  [fodders](../wiki/races/fodders.md)
  in the tide of my ascension. If they die, their souls will fuel my reach; if
  they live, they are merely tools that haven't broken yet. 



## Sellswords for Hire



  We will need better fights to aid me along the journey, and good fighters
  cost. I led the group into the more polish part of the town, looking for jobs.




  Our first task was a pittance from a local fool named Reinmar—a man who spent
  his time pouncing on birds while brigands made off with his "enchanted"
  dagger.

  We tracked the thieves to a clearing to the west.
  [NeCola](../wiki/characters/NeCola.md) remained by the wagons, her lungs still burning with alchemical fire. I
  led the "fish-fodder" forward. The brigands laughed when they saw us—a
  green-skinned freak and three peasants smelling of brine.





  The combat was a symphony of chaos.
  [Ingald](../wiki/characters/Ingald.md), his knuckles white upon a rusted pitchfork, stumbled in the mud—a pathetic
  display of mortal clumsiness. Yet, as the brigand leader lunged with the
  stolen dagger, the Raven’s Blessing held. He didn't just survive; he moved
  with a sudden, supernatural clarity. His knife found the gap in the raider’s
  leather with the cold precision of a falling star.




  I watched from the rear, my fingers tracing the air as Abyssal energies coiled
  around my staff like hungry vipers. The void provided. The brigands were
  either gutted by our band of [fodders](../wiki/races/fodders.md), or evaporated by my spell twisted shock*, and the "enchanted" dagger was ours.





  Aside from the dagger in the brigands' camp, a heavy, iron-bound crate sat
  amongst the spoils. When we pried it open, expecting relics of the Ancient
  Empire, we were met with a curse of a different sort. A brass-fitted
  contraption began to spin, emitting a looping, spectral tune.

  *🎵**Never gonna give you up.... **🎵 **never gonna let you down...*



  A multidimensional mockery, humming a synth-pop melody so annoyingly catchy it
  threatened to unravel the grimness of my crusade.

We have been rickrolled. I nearly executed the fisherman who began to tap his foot to the tempo.

## A Simple Delivery


  Having returned the dagger swiftly to our employer, he was satisfied. He
  offered us another job to deliver a mysterious chest to a noble named Eike in
  the town of[Thal](../wiki/locations/Thal.md). I agreed to take to quest.





  We marched east, first stopping by [Hammererden](../wiki/locations/Hammererden.md). The air growing thick with coal smoke and the metallic tang of hot
  iron. The road was a grueling slog;
  [Arnulf](../wiki/characters/Arnulf.md) was already showing the weariness of a soul tethered to a dark master.




  In the dead of night, the town’s back alleys twisted like gutted snakes. We
  sought an alchemist, but found an anatomist instead—a figure in a beaked mask
  whose den reeked of preserving salts and vinegar.





  "Knowledge demands sacrifice," the butcher whispered, his glass lenses
  reflecting my purple eyes. "Flesh for flesh."





  I did not hesitate. The path to the Usurper requires components that cannot be
  pried from common merchants. We cut straws, but the Abyss already knew its
  victim. [Bardol](../wiki/characters/Bardol.md) drew the short one. I watched with a cold, detached curiosity
  as he was strapped to an iron-framed table.




  For three hours, the screams echoed behind the blackened door. When he
  emerged, he was a broken thing, stiff and hollow-eyed, but he clutched a glass
  phial in his trembling hand: an Unhold’s Heart, still pulsing with a faint,
  regenerative rhythm.

  I can feel their resentment simmering beneath the surface, I mused, watching
  the other fishermen eye me with newfound terror. They realize now that they
  are not my brothers, but my reagents. Let them fear. Fear is a far more
  reliable tether than gold. [Bardol](../wiki/characters/Bardol.md)’s agony is the price of our progress. If I
  am to unseat a god-king, I cannot afford the luxury of a conscience.



## An Important Night of Rest


  We camped outside of town to rest up. Although I need no such thing called
  rest*, my [fodders](../wiki/races/fodders.md) need to be in shape to be effective meat shield. While
  they enjoy the weight of the few crows for their first day of service, I spent
  the night tending to the illness of
  [NeCola](../wiki/characters/NeCola.md).





  By Day 2, the mutation had finally taken its full hold of
  [NeCola](../wiki/characters/NeCola.md). She emerged from her fever no longer an ordinary shield maiden, but a
  [Vatt'ghern](../wiki/races/Vatt'ghern.md). Her eyes were yellow, slitted like a cat’s. Although still ill, she began
  to move with a predatory grace that silenced even the ravens. 





  We walked towards the next town along the road, [Thal](../wiki/locations/Thal.md). On the way there, we chanced upon a few nomads moving to jump on a Southern
  caravan. I ordered the charge. We left the sands red and the Southerners
  in our debt.



## Corrupted Local Nobles



  We reached [Thal](../wiki/locations/Thal.md) at midday, delivering the chest to the local noble Eike. He
  treated us with the disdain of a man who hasn't yet realized the world is
  ending. But it was the next contract that revealed the true rot. Another local
  noble named Frank complained of "unruly vagabonds" destroying his wheat
  fields.





  When we arrived, there were no men. There was only a manifestation of runaway
  life. Vines painted the buildings in a verdant crawl; grass grew in the pig
  pens; and in the cemetery, blue birds bathed in open graves where the dead had
  been displaced by the rising earth. [NeCola](../wiki/characters/NeCola.md)'s medallion hummed like a hornet’s
  nest against her chest. This was no bandit raid; it was a primal, unnatural
  surge.

  *The earth itself is restless,* I thought as I watched a vine slowly
  crush the stone of a farmhouse.
  *Is this the Usurper’s work, or is the world simply reacting to the
    [Changer](../wiki/characters/Changer.md)’s arrival? Frank wants his wheat, but he is blind to the fact that
    the soil no longer belongs to him. We will take his crowns and leave him to
    his vines. There are larger graves to dig.*





  We escorted his workers to clean up the field, staying only long enough to
  secure the 220 crowns promised. I watched the laborers begin their futile
  repairs, knowing they were little more than compost for the coming storm.




  As Day 2 drew to a close, we sat by the fire, the Unhold’s Heart thumping in
  my pack and the gold clinking in my purse. [NeCola](../wiki/characters/NeCola.md) sat awake, her yellow eyes
  tracking the darkness. We have survived the brine and the blood of our first
  days, but the Usurper's shadow is lengthening. And the Raven is always hungry.
