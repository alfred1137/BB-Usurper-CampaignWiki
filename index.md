## Introduction

The **Rise of the Usurper (RotU)** and **Path of the Vatt'ghern (PoV)** story follows the **Abyssal [Mage]({{ site.baseurl }}/Mage)**, [HiYun]({{ site.baseurl }}/HiYun), a noble-born scholar who discovered forbidden knowledge in a secret library. After surviving a ritual in a hidden crypt described in the **Raven Tome**, he becomes the "Chosen" of **The [Changer]({{ site.baseurl }}/Changer)** (the Great Raven), a god of chaos.

**The Divine Mandate:** The [Mage]({{ site.baseurl }}/Mage) is tasked with hunting down the **Usurper**, a rogue demon lord who has betrayed the god of death ([Davkul]({{ site.baseurl }}/Davkul)) and is spreading a **"Chaos Plague"** and mutating the world.
  
**The [Vatt'ghern]({{ site.baseurl }}/Vatt'ghern) Companion:** He is accompanied by [NeCola]({{ site.baseurl }}/NeCola), who underwent a painful, "Abyssal-stained" [Trial of the Grasses]({{ site.baseurl }}/Trial%20of%20the%20Grasses) to become a Witcher ([Vatt'ghern]({{ site.baseurl }}/Vatt'ghern)). She serves as a **moral fail-safe**, prepared to slay the [Mage]({{ site.baseurl }}/Mage) if his dark powers eventually erode his conscience.

**The Conflict:** The world is caught in an "eternal chess war" between the ruinous powers of chaos and death, manifesting through mortals who receive blessings or demonic corruption.
  
**The Ultimate Goal:** The story culminates in a descent into the [Usurper's Dungeon]({{ site.baseurl }}/Usurper's%20Dungeon), a 19-floor stronghold where the company must confront the [The Usurper King]({{ site.baseurl }}/The%20Usurper%20King) to end his reign of mutations and undeath.
