They\u2019re guaranteed to carry one <a href=\"#Named_and_Legendary_Items\">Named Item<\/a> and have significantly increased stats over their brethren. You\u2019ll be able to easily recognize them by their special base and unique name. They are, in a way, minibosses. They challenge you to fight hard to claim what is theirs, and they shake things up, but prevailing against them will always reward you with the <a href=\"#Named_and_Legendary_Items\">Named Item<\/a> they carry \u2013 be it weapon, shield, armor or helmet.<\/p>\n\n    <p>So where do you meet champions? The most reliable way is to complete <a href=\"#Contracts\">Contracts<\/a> with a difficulty rating of three skulls. Those have always been a high risk proposition for any mercenary company, but they now come with more of a reward for taking that chance: the possibility of getting named gear by facing enemy champions. Another way is to simply play into the late game. The further along your campaign, the more likely that you\u2019ll find champions roaming the world outside of <a href=\"#Contracts\">Contracts<\/a> or defending a location.<\/p>\n\n    <p>While champions may prove challenging to defeat, they are significantly easier to beat than some of the battles around <a href=\"#Legendary_Locations\">Legendary Locations<\/a>. This way, they can also fill the gap in challenge between defeating your first late game crisis and starting to take on <a href=\"#Legendary_Locations\">Legendary Locations<\/a>, like the <a href=\"#Black_Monolith\">Black Monolith<\/a>, with your company.<\/p>\n\n    \n    <div id=\"Named_and_Legendary_Items\"><\/div>\n    <div id=\"Contracts\"><\/div>\n    <div id=\"Legendary_Locations\"><\/div>\n    <div id=\"Black_Monolith\"><\/div>","is_private":0,"tooltip":null,"is_template":null,"is_attributes_private":0,"focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"created_at":"2026-01-13T06:27:26.000000Z","updated_at":"2026-01-13T08:48:34.000000Z","created_by":365072,"updated_by":365072,"image_path":null,"image_uuid":"a0d34e3f-08e6-44ff-9950-d6a82447ecbf","header_image":null,"header_uuid":null,"marketplace_uuid":null},"pivotLocations":[]}
