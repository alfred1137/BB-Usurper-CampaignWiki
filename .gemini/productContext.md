# Product Context

The purpose of this project is to create a comprehensive and easily accessible source of information for the "Usurper's Bane" Battle Brothers campaign. It serves as a narrative and mechanical reference for players and followers of the campaign.

The wiki is designed to be:
- **Collaborative:** Using git, multiple people can contribute to the wiki.
- **Easy to edit:** Pages are written in Markdown.
- **Static and fast:** Being a Jekyll site, it's just static HTML files.
- **Searchable:** The wiki includes a search function.
- **Blog-capable:** The site can also host blog-style posts for campaign updates.
