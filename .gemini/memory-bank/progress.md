# Progress

## What Works

- The basic structure of a Jekyll-based wiki is in place.
- The project is configured to use the `git-wiki-theme`.
- Docker-based local development is set up.
- Kanka.io entities (Journals, Characters, Locations, etc.) have been migrated to the wiki.
- Assets are organized and linked correctly in the content.
- Internal wiki links are resolved to `[[Name]]` format.

## What's Left to Build

- The visual style and branding may need further customization (Catppuccin theme).
- Verify all links and content formatting across the wiki.

## Known Issues

- None at this time.
