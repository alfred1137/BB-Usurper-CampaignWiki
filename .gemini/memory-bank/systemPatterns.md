# System Patterns

The core architectural pattern is a static site generated by Jekyll.

- **Content-as-Data:** All wiki pages and blog posts are stored as Markdown files in the `wiki/` and `_posts/` directories, respectively.
- **Remote Theming:** The project uses Jekyll's `remote_theme` feature to pull in the `git-wiki-theme`. This means the theme's files are not directly in this repository, but are fetched during the Jekyll build process. This keeps the wiki's content separate from the theme's presentation logic.
- **Configuration-driven:** The `_config.yml` file is central to the site's configuration. It controls everything from the site's title and description to which features are enabled (e.g., blog, search).
- **Dockerized Environment:** The `docker-compose.yml` file defines services for running the Jekyll site locally in a containerized environment, ensuring consistency across different development machines.
- **Extensibility via Includes:** The `git-wiki-theme` allows for customization by including custom HTML files via the `_includes` directory and `inc_*` settings in `_config.yml`. The project currently uses this to add a custom sidebar.
