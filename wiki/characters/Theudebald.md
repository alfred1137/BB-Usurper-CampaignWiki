## Description

Theudebald was a vagabond who spent his days traveling aimlessly between cities and the wild. He joined the company in [Fuhrtmark]({{ site.baseurl }}/Fuhrtmark), claiming to have met a "brother-he-never-had" who pointed him toward the mercenary life. His purposeless days took a dark turn at the Remote Graveyard, where he was struck down and reanimated as a zombified Wiederganger. He continued to serve as mindless fodder until he was finally "graduated" to permanent death during a clash with a Northern Champion.

## Notable Record

* **Zombified Servant**: Continued to march and fight even after his heart had stopped beating, serving as a silent sentinel for the company.
* **Vagabond Resilience**: Survived a grueling trek through the mountains and a harrowing battle against geists before his transition.
