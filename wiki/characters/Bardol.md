## Description

Bardol was one of the original "fodder" recruits plucked from the nets of Stohl. Bestowed with the Raven's Blessing, he became a "blessed" survivor of the company's early skirmishes. He became a living legend for his unnatural ability to survive being struck down repeatedly, particularly in the Arena of Ras Karim, where he defied death multiple times to the roar of the crowd. His luck finally ran dry in the desert sands during a confrontation with a Necromancer.

## Notable Record

* **Indestructible**: Earned his alias by surviving being "struck down" in three consecutive arena bouts in a single day.
* **Raven's Blessing**: One of the first to receive the mark, manifesting as glowing purple eyes.
* **The investigation sacrifice**: Trade his physical integrity for an Unhold's Heart during a dark investigation in Hammererden.
