## Description

Kaetherlen was a "bone cripple" who joined the company already halfway to the grave. His brittle frame made him a prime candidate for the company's dark experiments, yet he survived numerous skirmishes against brigands and beasts. His journey reached a final, ironic conclusion at the Ruins of Blackwatch Keep, where his skull was smashed into fine white powder by the ancient mummies guarding the site.

## Notable Record

* **Irony of Undeath**: A man who looked like a skeleton met his end at the hands of true skeletal warriors.
* **Resilient Fodder**: Defied his brittle origins by surviving long enough to see the company reach its full strength.
