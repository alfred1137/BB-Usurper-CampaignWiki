## Description

NeCola, the striking white-haired guardian of the company, underwent a painful and "Abyssal-stained" **[Trial of the Grasses]({{ site.baseurl }}/Trial%20of%20the%20Grasses)** to become a Witcher (**[Vatt'ghern]({{ site.baseurl }}/Vatt%27ghern)**). Though the process left her ill for a time, she emerged with predatory grace and inhuman strength. She serves as both [HiYun]({{ site.baseurl }}/HiYun)'s most loyal blade and his moral fail-safe, prepared to end his life should his dark powers consume his humanity. Known as "The Silver Sword," she is a whirlwind of steel on the battlefield, often dealing devastating damage to the company's most dangerous foes.

Before joining the party, she was a shieldmaiden. She is a fierce warrior from the northern settlements, where ideas about the fairer sex tend to be far rougher. She is someone who has seen her fair share of war and beast hunting.

Although her tribe was most known for the warriors' skill with spear and shield, she predominately fight with a two-handed spear ever since the mutation. To her, the best defence is a good offence when fighting the chaos.

## Notable Record

* **[Vatt'ghern]({{ site.baseurl }}/Vatt%27ghern) Transformation**: Successfully survived the brutal [Trial of the Grasses]({{ site.baseurl }}/Trial%20of%20the%20Grasses).

* **Unnatural Resilience**: Overcame the severe sickness following her mutation while still securing kills on the field.
