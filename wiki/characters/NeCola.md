## Description

NeCola, the striking white-haired guardian of the company, underwent a painful and "Abyssal-stained" **[Trial of the Grasses]({{ site.baseurl }}/Trial%20of%20the%20Grasses)** to become a Witcher (**[Vatt'ghern]({{ site.baseurl }}/Vatt%27ghern)**). Though the process left her ill for a time, she emerged with predatory grace and inhuman strength. She serves as both [HiYun]({{ site.baseurl }}/HiYun)'s most loyal blade and his moral fail-safe, prepared to end his life should his dark powers consume his humanity. Known as "The Silver Sword," she is a whirlwind of steel on the battlefield, often dealing devastating damage to the company's most dangerous foes.
