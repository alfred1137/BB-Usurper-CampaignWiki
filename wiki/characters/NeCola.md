## Description

NeCola, the striking white-haired guardian of the company, underwent a painful and "Abyssal-stained" **Trial of the Grasses** to become a Witcher (**Vatt'ghern**). Though the process left her ill for a time, she emerged with predatory grace and inhuman strength. She serves as both HiYun's most loyal blade and his moral fail-safe, prepared to end his life should his dark powers consume his humanity. Known as "The Silver Sword," she is a whirlwind of steel on the battlefield, often dealing devastating damage to the company's most dangerous foes.

## Notable Record

* **Vatt'ghern Transformation**: Successfully survived the brutal Trial of the Grasses.
* **Slayer of Champions**: Has personally dispatched numerous champions, including Orc Berserkers and Northern Kings.
* **Unnatural Resilience**: Overcame the severe sickness following her mutation while still securing kills on the field.
