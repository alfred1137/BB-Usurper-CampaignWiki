## Description

Dauid was a trauma-scarred survivor of a destroyed village who joined the company during their trek to Stohl. He quickly became a "permanent injury collector," surviving battle after battle while sustaining horrific damage that would have killed a normal man multiple times over. By the time the company reached the southern deserts, he had earned the nickname "The Human Jigsaw Puzzle" due to his collection of seven permanent deformities. His long and painful service finally ended in the northern mountains during a brutal encounter with a pack of Webknechts and an Ancient Champion.

## Notable Record

* **Injury Collector**: Survived with 7 permanent injuries, including being "struck down" in nearly every fight during the southern campaign.
* **Walking Miracle**: Frequently took damage that exceeded his maximum vitality, yet continued to stand through sheer spite and the Abyssal Mage's dark influence.
* **Final Graduation**: Died permanently while forming a "wall of meat" against a horde of spiders.
