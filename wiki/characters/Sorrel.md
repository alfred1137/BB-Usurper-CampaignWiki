## Description

Sorrel was a miner from Gipfelfeste whose life was defined by a tragic accident in the dark tunnels where he unintentionally killed a coworker. Seeking to escape the memory of his past, he joined the company as fodder. He carried the grim strength of a man used to breaking stone and survived several brutal mountain skirmishes. His journey reached its final stop during a rematch with a self-proclaimed "King of the North," where he fell holding the line for his brothers.

## Notable Record

* **Stone-Hardened**: Utilized his mining background to provide much-needed strength to the company's early northern frontline.
* **Fallen at the Rematch**: Met his end during the company's decisive victory over a Northern Champion.
