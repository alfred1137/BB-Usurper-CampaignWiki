## Description

Harun is a renowned tailor whose career in the southern city-states ended following a fierce competition that left a man dead in linen. She joined the company in [Ka-Sabar]({{ site.baseurl }}/Ka-Sabar), seeking a new life beyond the needle. Though she initially lacked the formal training for combat, she demonstrated immense potential for high-initiative warfare. Under [HiYun]({{ site.baseurl }}/HiYun)'s instruction, she began studying a rare light armor textbook to master the art of fighting "nimble," trading her fabrics for a scimitar.

## Notable Record

* **Education of a Warrior**: Spent weeks studying a specialized manual to master the fluid footwork and weight distribution required for nimble combat.
* **Battlefield Transition**: Successfully survived numerous high-stakes encounters, proving that the precision of a tailor can be refined into the lethality of a soldier.
