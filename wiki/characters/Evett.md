## Description

Evett, known as "The Rabbit" for her speed and lethal precision, was a consistent and effective member of the company's inner circle. After taking brutal damage during a retrieval mission, she was "zombified" (likely via the Chaos Plague or the Raven's intervention), becoming a tireless, unliving scout. Her unique journey from a swift human to a resilient revenant ended abruptly in the southern deserts, where she and [Arnulf]({{ site.baseurl }}/Arnulf) met their final deaths at the jaws of a hyena.

## Notable Record

* **Revenant Transition**: Continued her service as a zombie after a "not-purposely" sacrificial mission into a brigand den.
* **Consistent Performer**: Secured multiple kills and maintained high damage output throughout the northern campaign.
