## Description

HiYun is a noble-born scholar who discovered forbidden knowledge in a secret library. After surviving a ritual in a hidden crypt described in the **Raven Tome**, he becomes the "Chosen" of **The [Changer]({{ site.baseurl }}/Changer)** (the Great Raven), a god of chaos. He bears a ghastly green visage, a mark of his descent into the Abyss. As the calculating leader of [The Usurper's Bane]({{ site.baseurl }}/The%20Usurper%27s%20Bane), he wields dark magic fueled by the essence of his enemies, often sacrificing "fodder" recruits to achieve his dark ambitions.
