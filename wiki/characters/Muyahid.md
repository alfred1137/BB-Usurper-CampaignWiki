## Description

Muyahid Ibn Nusa was a shepherd whose career ended when he accidentally led his entire flock over a cliff. He joined the company in Makan Muqadas, bringing with him an uncanny knowledge of the stars and a keen sense of hearing. However, his service was short-lived; he was cleaved apart by an Orc Warrior in his first engagement. Raised as a zombie thrall by the Abyssal [Mage]({{ site.baseurl }}/Mage), he continued to serve as mindless fodder until his "ultimate death" when his head was minced into the desert sand during a nomad ambush.

## Notable Record

* **Brief Service**: One of the fastest members to transition from living recruit to unliving thrall.
* **Keen Senses**: Possessed the ability to locate sounds in the darkness and navigate by the stars.
