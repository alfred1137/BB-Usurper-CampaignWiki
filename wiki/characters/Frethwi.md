## Description

Frethwi is an Oldling, a rare being touched by the [Changer]({{ site.baseurl }}/Changer) and predestined with a powerful flux ability. He carries the aura of an ancient soul and possesses a deep aversion to traditional weapons or armor, viewing his own body as his primary tool of warfare. He joined the company in [Raven Watch]({{ site.baseurl }}/Raven%20Watch) for a massive sum, with the ultimate goal of mastering the "Schart" transformation—a process that would turn him into a nightmare of flesh and bone on the battlefield.

## Notable Record

* **Primordial Power**: Represents a significant investment of over 10,000 crowns by the company to secure his ancient lineage.
* **Flesh over Steel**: Relies entirely on his natural resilience and flux abilities rather than conventional mercenary gear.
