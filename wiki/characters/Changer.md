## Description

The Changer, also known as the Great Raven or the Winged Architect, is a god of chaos who has taken an interest in the mortal realm. He chose HiYun as his champion, granting him the power of the Abyss to combat the Usurper King. The Changer's influence is often felt through the "Raven's Blessing" or "Raven's Curse" bestowed upon those who serve the company, granting them dark powers at a significant physical cost.
