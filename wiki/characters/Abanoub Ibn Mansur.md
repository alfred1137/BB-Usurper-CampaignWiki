## Description

Abanoub is an unfortunate soul born into a family of Indebted in the southern city-states. Having spent his entire life in chains to pay for the religious transgressions of his ancestors, he joined [The Usurper's Bane]({{ site.baseurl }}/The%20Usurper%27s%20Bane) in a desperate bid for freedom. As an Indebted member, he serves without a salary, seeking to earn his "salvation" through the blood and sand of the mercenary life.

## Notable Record

* **Desert Survivor**: Withstood the brutal heat and deadly encounters of the southern dunes, including clashes with Necromancers and Demonic [Champions]({{ site.baseurl }}/Champions).
