## Description

Ingjald was one of the three original fishermen recruited in [Stohl]({{ site.baseurl }}/Stohl). Like his companions, he was bestowed with the Raven's Blessing, which granted him the resilience to survive the company's early trials. He was a reliable part of the "meat shield" vanguard until the company encountered the Orc Berserker Champion, Bakh Lob. He fell in the mud, sacrificing his life so that [NeCola]({{ site.baseurl }}/NeCola) could strike the killing blow.

## Notable Record

* **Raven's Blessing**: Manifested glowing eyes and enhanced durability.
* **Stable Survivor**: Unlike his peers, he often survived battles with minimal damage until his final encounter.
