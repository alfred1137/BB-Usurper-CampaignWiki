## Description

Arnulf was a fisherman from [Stohl]({{ site.baseurl }}/Stohl) who became a "Walking Miracle" of the company. After being mangled in early battles, he achieved his true "ascension" by rising as a Zombie (Cursed Shell) following a brutal clash with a Northern Champion. He served as a tireless, unliving anchor for the line, soaking up incredible amounts of damage while never gaining a single point of experience. His long journey of survival finally ended in the southern deserts, where a lone hyena claimed his unlife.

## Notable Record

* **Cursed Shell**: The first member of the company to fully transition into an undead state while remaining in service.
* **Damage Sponge**: Took nearly 750 damage in a single fight against an Orc Berserker Champion and remained standing.
* **Eternal Novice**: Despite surviving countless horrors and absorbing thousands of points of damage, he never secured a kill or gained a level.
