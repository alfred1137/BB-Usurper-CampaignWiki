## Description

The Usurper King is a rogue demon lord who has betrayed the god of death ([Davkul]({{ site.baseurl }}/Davkul)) and is spreading a "Chaos Plague" across the land. He sits upon a throne built of lies and stolen blood, mutating the world and its inhabitants to suit his dark vision. He is the ultimate target of [HiYun]({{ site.baseurl }}/HiYun) and [NeCola]({{ site.baseurl }}/NeCola)'s quest, though his influence is felt in every corner of the world, from the sentient vines of the south to the possessed warriors of the north.
