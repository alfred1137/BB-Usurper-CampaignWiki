## Description

Frethold was a merchant mariner who had been captured by pirates and marched in chains as one of the "indebted." He was freed when his former sailing companion, Bardol, recognized him during a chance encounter in the southern deserts. Grateful for his salvation, he joined the company as fodder. However, the desert was not kind to him; he met his end alongside his savior during a "dance" with a lone hyena.

## Notable Record

* **Serendipitous Salvation**: Freed from slavery by a chance meeting with an old friend on the road to Ras Karim.
* **Brutal End**: Drowned in the sands during his very first day of service to the company.
