## Description

Eufrosina was a "regular melon thief" who joined the company in the northern lands. Designated as fodder, she found that cracking skulls in the service of the Abyss was far more dangerous than stealing fruit. Her brief career ended during the harrowing purge of the Drafty Shack, where the screams of geists claimed her life alongside others.

## Notable Record

* **Fruitless Service**: Traded a life of petty theft for the lethal reality of mercenary combat.
* **Geist Victim**: Fell during one of the company's most mentally taxing encounters.
