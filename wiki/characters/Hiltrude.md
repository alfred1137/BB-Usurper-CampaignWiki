## Description

Hiltrude was a widow from Ohnemenschen whose life fell apart after a brigand struck her husband down. Forced onto the streets and depending on the goodwill of others, her health had declined significantly by the time she joined the company for a mere 50 crowns. She was designated as fodder and met a swift and messy end during the purge of the Remote Graveyard, where she fell to the supernatural horrors haunting the site.

## Notable Record

* **Desperate Recruit**: Joined the company for one of the lowest signing fees in its history.
* **Messy End**: Her death was so violent that little remained of her to stitch back together, preventing even a zombified "ascension."
