## Description

Thordis is a skilled arbalester who was found trapped and starving within the ruins of the Remote Graveyard following the company's purge of the geists. Rescued from the grasp of supernatural horrors, he swore to return the favor by lending his trained hands to the Usurper's Bane. He carries a burning hatred for the spectral things that once held him captive, a fire that makes him a particularly effective hunter of the undead.

## Notable Record

* **Lone Survivor**: Managed to stay alive for days within a geist-infested ruin without food or water.
* **Vengeful Marksman**: His personal grudge against supernatural entities grants him a relentless focus when facing the company's most bizarre enemies.
