## Description

Arngrimr joined the company during its early days in [Thal]({{ site.baseurl }}/Thal) as a fresh sacrifice for the Abyss. Though he showed promise by quickly gaining experience in his first skirmish, his career was cut short during the desperate battle against the Orc Berserker Champion, Bakh Lob. He fell alongside Ingjald, providing the necessary distraction for the company's leaders to prevail.

## Notable Record

* **Rapid Learner**: Jumped straight to 100 XP in a single morning skirmish shortly after recruitment.
* **Champion's Sacrifice**: Died in the line of duty against one of the most dangerous foes the company had faced at that point.
