## Description

Fressenda is a Witchhunter with a reputation for appearing wherever extraordinary or supernatural events unfold. A silent observer who studies her targets like a bird of prey, she joined the company in [Thal]({{ site.baseurl }}/Thal), drawn by their association with the Abyssal [Mage]({{ site.baseurl }}/Mage) and the [Vatt'ghern]({{ site.baseurl }}/Vatt%27ghern). She is a consummate professional with a crossbow, possessing a steady hand and a cold resolve that is not easily shaken by the horrors of the world.
