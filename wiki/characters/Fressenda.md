## Description

Fressenda is a Witchhunter with a reputation for appearing wherever extraordinary or supernatural events unfold. A silent observer who studies her targets like a bird of prey, she joined the company in Thal, drawn by their association with the Abyssal Mage and the Vatt'ghern. She is a consummate professional with a crossbow, possessing a steady hand and a cold resolve that is not easily shaken by the horrors of the world.
