## Description

Godfrey is a brawler who loves a good fight as much as he loves a strong drink. Previously employed by a local lord to fistfight royal champions, he joined the company in [Gipfelfeste]({{ site.baseurl }}/Gipfelfeste) seeking greater challenges and more lucrative work. His life took a dark turn when [HiYun]({{ site.baseurl }}/HiYun) bestowed upon him the Raven's Curse—a dark binding that grants him Abyssal powers at the cost of his physical strength. He now walks a path of purification, seeking to master the mark before it consumes his body.

## Notable Record

* **Raven's Curse**: One of the few members to receive the direct mark of the Winged Architect, sapping his strength in exchange for dark utility.
* **Fist to Steel**: Successfully transitioned from the arena of royal fistfights to the lethal reality of mercenary combat.
