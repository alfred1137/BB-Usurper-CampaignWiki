## Description

Wilfried is an Ancestral Vatgern, a fierce-looking spirit clad in the armor of his previous life. His drive to complete his mission was so strong that even death could not stop his ambition. Having made a compact with the Azure Lord to live on in spectral form, he joined the company in [Raven Watch]({{ site.baseurl }}/Raven%20Watch). As a ghostly warrior, he possesses unnatural defensive capabilities and remains an unmovable wall on the frontline, his ghostly edge seeking to finish what he started in his mortal coil.

## Notable Record

* **Beyond Death**: One of the few spectral members of the company, bound by a pact with a deity to continue his service.
* **Spectral Defender**: Renowned for his exceptional melee defense, often holding the line against overwhelming odds without taking a single scratch.
