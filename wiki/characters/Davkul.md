## Description

Davkul is the ancient god of death, whose domain has been encroached upon by the rogue demon lord known as the Usurper King. Once the ultimate authority on the transition from life to the beyond, Davkul was betrayed by the Usurper, who now uses the dead for his own chaotic purposes. While Davkul's own followers are often seen as sinister, they find themselves in a strange alignment with the Usurper's Bane in their shared desire to see the "False God-King" deposed.

## Notable Record

* **Betrayed Authority**: Lost a portion of his dominion over death following the Usurper King's ascension.
* **Sinister Silence**: Often remains distant from mortal affairs, yet his presence is felt in every cold grave and ancient tomb.
