## Description

Imamaddin is a former juggler whose career ended when he destroyed his own work in a fit of arrogant pique. He joined the company in [Ras Karim]({{ site.baseurl }}/Ras%20Karim), carrying a musk of arrogance and a tongue sharper than his daggers. Though thin-skinned and overly critical, he possesses high initiative and a certain flair for combat, particularly with the reach flail. He often claims credit for the company's victories, even when his own contribution is "pedestrian at best."

## Notable Record

* **Lucky Charm**: Discovered a Famed Marvellous Coat in a loot crate during the northern campaign.
* **Flail Master**: Effectively utilized the reach flail to soften up armored foes and secure kills during the southern deserts campaign.
