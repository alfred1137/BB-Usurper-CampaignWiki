## Description

Jan was an impatient student of a Swordmaster who lacked the mental aptitude for traditional training but made up for it with sheer effort. Recruited in [Fuhrtmark]({{ site.baseurl }}/Fuhrtmark), he was dubbed "The Bright" for his enthusiasm. Despite being designated as fodder, he survived multiple meat-grinders and absorbed staggering amounts of punishment, becoming more scar tissue than man. His light finally flickered out in the desert during a confrontation with a Necromancer.

## Notable Record

* **Swordmaster's Rejection**: Joined the company after failing to stick with traditional martial trials.
* **Indestructible Fodder**: Survived multiple battles despite sustaining near-lethal injuries (over 170 HP damage in one instance).
