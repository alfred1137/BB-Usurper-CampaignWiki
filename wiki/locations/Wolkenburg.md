Wolkenburg is a massive stone citadel built into the steep mountains of the far north. It is a militant fortress designed to hold a firm grip on the land, with a large number of soldiers stationed within its unyielding walls. The air here is thick with coal fires and the smell of oil, a stark bastion against the frozen end of the world.

## Notable Events

* **The Slayers of the Primal**: The company marched through the gates not as weary travelers, but as heroes after slaying the legendary juggernaut Borealis the Primal in the mountain pass.
* **The High-Noble Armory**: The citadel serves as a prime location for the company to repair its legendary trophies and recruit elite northern warriors.
