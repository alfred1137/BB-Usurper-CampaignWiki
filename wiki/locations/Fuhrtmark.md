Fuhrtmark is a village surrounded by dense, shadow-choked forests in the eastern lands. It is a place of modest wooden palisades and thatched roofs, often isolated and vulnerable to the horrors that roam the primeval timber. The town has been a frequent source of high-paying, high-risk contracts for the company.
