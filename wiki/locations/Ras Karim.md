Ras Karim is a prominent southern City-State rising from the shifting dunes of the desert. It is a hub of trade and entertainment, most famous for its high-walled Arena where blood is spilled for the amusement of the Gilded and the profit of mercenaries. The city's markets are known for their exceptional prices, making it a favorite destination for companies looking to offload their loot.
