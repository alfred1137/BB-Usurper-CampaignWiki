Stohl is a coastal settlement located on the outskirts of the Southern Wilds. It served as the starting point for HiYun and NeCola's journey to topple the Usurper King. The town is a modest hub of trade and industry, featuring a bustling harbor that connects the northern lands to the southern city-states. It was here that the company recruited its first "fodder" members from the local fishermen and accepted its first contracts from Reinmar of Stohl.
