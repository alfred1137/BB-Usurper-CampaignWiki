Gipfelfeste is a high mountain fortress city known for its jagged towers and cold, crisp air. It serves as a major hub for military and mercenary activities in the northern peaks. It was here that The Usurper's Bane reached its full strength of twelve members and first began to project its presence as a regional power.
