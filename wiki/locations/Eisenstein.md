Eisenstein is an industrial settlement carved directly into the slopes of the surrounding mountains. The town is defined by the constant hammering of pickaxes and the soot-stained faces of its hard-working miners. It is a place of grit and labor, where the folk are as unyielding as the stone they break.

## Notable Events

* **The Birthday Blunder**: A contract to hunt "monstrous" beasts ended with HiYun flinging a giant spider corpse into the village headman's birthday party.
* **The Staff of Foresight**: The company retrieved a holy relic for a druidic monk from the ghost-infested Ruins of Blackwatch Keep.
* **The Unholy Alliance**: A desperate battle against a pack of 14 Webknechts and an Ancient Champion took place in the woods just outside the town.
