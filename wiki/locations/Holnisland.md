Holnisland is a coastal settlement located west of [Hammererden]({{ site.baseurl }}/Hammererden). It is a smaller village that feels "heavy" with the scent of the sea and rot. Surrounded by dense, ancient woodlands, it is a place where the barrier between the mundane and the supernatural often feels thin.

## Notable Events

* **The Beast Tamer Encounter**: A chance meeting on the road to the village involving a wildman cage and a gruesome retrieval task.
* **The Recovered Crown**: A retrieval mission that saw the company crush a brigand warband to return an ancient crown to Adalbert the Younger.
