Makan Muqadas is the religious heart of the Southern City-States, a city of shimmering white domes and towering minarets dedicated to the Gilder. It is a place of incense, ancient relics, and strict laws, governed by powerful Viziers who command from silken thrones. The city serves as a bastion of faith against the creeping darkness of the desert.
