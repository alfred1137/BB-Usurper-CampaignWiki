Thal is a town located a day's march east of Stohl. Known for its extensive wheat fields, it has been a frequent site of both supernatural anomalies and contract work for The Usurper's Bane. The town is governed by a series of stewards and elders, including Frank of Thal and Volmar the Steward, who have often called upon the company to resolve their numerous crises.

## Notable Events

* **The Verdant Crawl**: A manifestation of primal, runaway life that saw vines painting buildings and grass growing in pig pens, nearly reclaiming the local farmland.
* **The Nachzehrer Siege**: The town was plagued by "beasts with glowing red eyes" that slaughtered cattle and men alike, eventually revealed to be a directed threat led by a Noble Seer.
* **The Stolen Talisman**: A high-profile retrieval mission that solidified the company's reputation in the region.
