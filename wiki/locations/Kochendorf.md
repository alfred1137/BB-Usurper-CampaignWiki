Kochendorf is a prospering village surrounded by fertile land in the central heartlands. The market is usually filled with all kinds of fresh food and high-quality goods. It has become a pivotal point for The Usurper's Bane, where they recruited several legendary members and overcame significant supernatural threats.

## Notable Events

* **The Nachzehrer Infestation**: The company purged a massive flock of over 20 Nachzehrers that threatened to swallow the village whole.
* **The Remote Graveyard Purge**: A harrowing 11-round battle against Geists and Possessed Nobles that left the company wealthy but bloodied.
* **The Recruitment of Legends**: Maike the Vala and Lady Amelia the Swordmaster were both recruited in or near this village.
