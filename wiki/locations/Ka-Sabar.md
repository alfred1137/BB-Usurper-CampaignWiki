Ka-Sabar, known as "The Gilded Pearl," is a prominent southern City-State. It is a world of shimmering spires, sweltering heat, and strict laws governed by the Viziers. As a major hub of trade in the south, it offers lucrative contracts and high-end markets, though the desert sun can be as deadly as the enemies lurking in the dunes.
