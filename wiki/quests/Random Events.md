The road is never truly safe, and the Usurper's Bane has encountered numerous strange and often surreal events during their travels.

## Notable Encounters

### The Rickroll Curse
On multiple occasions, the company discovered iron-bound loot crates that, instead of containing riches, emitted a spectral, rhythmic tune: "Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down." These metaphysical pranks became a recurring source of frustration for HiYun and his men.

### The Campfire Nightmare
During a cold night in the northern forests, HiYun experienced a vivid waking nightmare where Wilfried B was transformed into a human torch by a tiny spider. The event left the company shaken, hinting at an ethereal presence stalking their journey.

### The Animal Tamer
The company once encountered a "purveyor of exotic challenges" named Pike, who was transporting dangerous beasts, including a feral human. The encounter resulted in a gruesome task to retrieve a corpse from a cage, further hardening the company's resolve.

### The Outsiders
In the back alleys of Hammererden, the company encountered two strange visitors speaking in foreign tongues (Russian and Greek), hinting at a world much larger and more fractured than previously realized.
