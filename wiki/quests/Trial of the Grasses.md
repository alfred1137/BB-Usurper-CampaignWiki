The Trial of the Grasses is the character arc of [NeCola]({{ site.baseurl }}/NeCola), depicting her transformation into a mutant monster-slayer.

## The Transformation

[NeCola]({{ site.baseurl }}/NeCola) willingly submitted to a brutal process of alchemical rewiring known as the Trial of the Grasses. The process, which leaves most subjects dead or broken, used "Abyssal-stained" mutagens to enhance her physical capabilities beyond human limits. The screams of the ordeal echoed through the camp for days, leaving her temporarily enfeebled by a severe "Trial Sickness."

## Notable Outcomes

* **[Vatt'ghern]({{ site.baseurl }}/Vatt%27ghern) Ascension**: [NeCola]({{ site.baseurl }}/NeCola) emerged with predatory grace, heightened senses, and yellow slitted eyes.
* **The Medallion**: The company gained the ability to craft [Vatt'ghern]({{ site.baseurl }}/Vatt%27ghern) Medallions, silver anchors that vibrate in the presence of magic and monsters.
* **Geist Mutation**: Later studies of ethereal remains yielded a Geist Mutagen, further bridging the gap between her mortal frame and the spirit world.
