The Ascension is the character arc of [HiYun]({{ site.baseurl }}/HiYun), detailing his transformation into the Abyssal Mage.

## The Ritual

In a hidden crypt buried beneath the world, HiYun performed a forbidden ritual described in the ancient **Raven Tome**. By embracing the Abyss and surviving the psychic toll, he was chosen by [The Changer]({{ site.baseurl }}/Changer) (the Great Raven) to serve as his champion. This event marked the beginning of his quest to topple the Usurper King.

## Notable Outcomes

* **Abyssal Power**: Unlocked the ability to manipulate shadow and energy, including the "Twisted Shock" technique.
* **Mark of the Chosen**: HiYun's physical appearance was forever changed, his face turning a ghastly green.
