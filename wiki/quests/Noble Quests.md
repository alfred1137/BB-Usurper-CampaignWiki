Contracts from the high-born and the powerful often carry greater risk but offer significant rewards.

## Notable Contracts

### The Staff of Foresight
The company was hired by a druidic monk and Hallstein of Eisenstein to retrieve a holy relic from the ghost-infested Ruins of Blackwatch Keep. The mission was successful but resulted in the death of Kaetherlen.

### The Butcher's "Favor"
A suspicious man known as "The Butcher" offered a massive sum for a "shopping trip" in Ohnemenschen. Sensing a trap, HiYun wisely declined the offer.
