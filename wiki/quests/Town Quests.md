The Usurper's Bane has performed numerous tasks for the elders and stewards of the realm's settlements. These missions, ranging from simple deliveries to high-stakes defense, have provided the gold and renown necessary for the company's growth.

## Notable Contracts

### The Stolen Enchanted Dagger
One of the company's earliest tasks in Stohl involved retrieving a "valuable" dagger for Reinmar. The mission resulted in the company's first encounter with a "Rickroll" crate.

### The Verdant Crawl
The company was hired by Frank of Thal to clear a "bandit" infestation that was actually a manifestation of primal, runaway life. The company successfully "cleared" the area while doing the bare minimum of work.

### The Stuffed Bear Heist
A bizarre contract in Hammarsted where the company tracked down a group of "vagabonds" (and their goblin allies) to recover a child's toy for Tymmeke the Elder.

### The Purge of the Drafty Shack
A high-paying but deadly contract in Fuhrtmark to eliminate geists from an old quarry. The mission was successful but resulted in the permanent death of Eufrosina.

### The Siege of Thal
The company defended the village of Thal from a "massive assault" of brigands and a Flesh Golem, earning the eternal (and monetary) gratitude of Volmar the Steward.
