In the grim world of the Usurper's Bane, life is cheap. "Fodders" refers to the expendable recruits—often desperate peasants, fishermen, or refugees—who are hired by the company to serve as a "wall of meat."


They are often marked with the Raven's Blessing to increase their durability, not out of care for their lives, but to ensure they last long enough to serve their purpose. When they inevitably fall, they may find themselves "rising" again as zombified thralls, continuing their service beyond the grave.
