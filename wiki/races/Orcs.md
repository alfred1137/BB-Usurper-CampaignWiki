## Orcs

Orcs are all very tough and strong. Their weapons are crude but very heavy, and Orcs also have damage modifiers, dealing even more damage with them. Stronger Orcs are immune to stun and pushback. All Orcs are easy to hit, having low or negative defense values, and their resolve also isn't very high.


Orc units either are glass cannons, like Young and Berserkers, or wear heavy armor, like Warriors and Warlords. All their weapons are melee with the exception of Crude Javelins sometimes used by Orc Young.


Orcs use their brute force to gain advantage: Young and sometimes Berserkers will jump onto you and stun, and Warriors will push your frontline fighters to reach usually more vulnerable backline.



## Description

Orcs are large, bulky greenskins with great strength and vitality. Their culture revolves around violence and martial prowess, and their society is structured around the strong taking from the weak. Unlike the closely-related [Goblins]({{ site.baseurl }}/Goblins), they are brutes which see little purpose in blacksmithing or agriculture, preferring to raid and pillage to get what they need.



### Political and Social Structure

Most Orcs live in nomadic clans, moving and setting up new camps to pillage other civilizations or clans. A typical clan is commanded by a Warlord - the strongest and biggest Orc in the clan. The rest of the Orcs obey him without question - unless someone feels strong enough to challenge him to a fight. Successions are usually in the form of armed combat and are often bloody. Constant small scale skirmishes and clan infighting are seen as the norm. Young Orcs often raid civilized settlements as Orc Marauders to prove themselves and to bring back weapons or tools for their clan.

### Military Structure

The military structure of Orcs is rather simple: the strong rule and the weak obey. On top resides the Warlord, which is the strongest and most cunning Orc in the clan. Their status permits them to use the best weapons and armor. As war leaders, they can easily intimidate enemies and boost the morale of their forces by the use of their warcry.


Orc Warriors are older Orcs that were forged into mighty fighters over their lifespan. They are larger, stronger and more skilled than Orc Young, using better weapons and armor. Able to use both their natural strength and crude yet heavy armor, they are extremely dangerous opponents for an unprepared force. They are the foot soldiers of a clan and make up the main bulk of their forces.


Berserkers are Orcs who aspire to achieve great status or improve their martial skills. Often excluded from normal orc structure, they form bonds outside their clans with other similar individuals. As they lack resources and status to become Warriors, they concentrate on improving their skills by any means necessary. Their fighting skills are unmatched and they are cunning enemies that are not afraid of death. They often fight with no armor showing off their bodies' scars and marks of defeated enemies.


The rest are called Orc Young - no matter of their true age. The Young ones are the Orcs with the lowest status but there is a big difference within their ranks; the most crafty and skilled often have a good set of armor and weapons while the lowest often have only a tree branch as their equipment (big and heavy tree branches).


Sometimes a Warlord appears who unites a few clans under his command. These legendary leaders take a title of Khan. There are many anecdotes about them pillaging civilized lands. All of them are about the past.



### Military Tactics

Orcs are all offense.


A battle usually starts with a strong charge of many Orc Young. As they lack discipline they rely on their impetuousness and physical superiority to stun and throw an enemy into disarray. As prolonged melee is often deadly for light armored Orc Young, some smarter Young use Javelins to provide support. They lack other means to fight at range which a smart commander can utilize at his advantage.


The Berserkers are often used as flanking troops, trying to attack the enemy's rear or flank. As they are dangerous in melee so they should be countered by mass use of ranged weapons. If not killed quickly, they could inflict heavy casualties. Luckily, they are rarely armored.


Orc Warriors enter a battle as the last. They lack the impetuousness of young orcs but they have tremendous staying power. Their armor and bulky bodies grant them resistance from many attacks. They also use their big stature to easily push lesser enemies around by breaking enemy defensive formations. The best counter against them are heavy anti-armor weapons like heavy axes, hammers, and billhooks. Beware, however, Orc Warriors can easily kill given their immense strength. Additionally, they are immune to being stunned.


The Warlord often supports his forces from the rear, using his voice to terrify the enemy and bolster his subordinates. But make no mistake - in melee he is even more heavily armored and dangerous than Orc Warriors.
