In the grim world of the Usurper's Bane, life is cheap. "Fodders" refers to the expendable recruits—often desperate peasants, fishermen, or refugees—who are hired by the company to serve as a "wall of meat" for the elite members.

## The Life of Fodder

Fodders are frequently marked with the Raven's Blessing or Curse to increase their durability, not out of care for their lives, but to ensure they last long enough to serve their tactical purpose. They are often sent into the most dangerous positions, soaking up the initial charge of orcs or the terrifying screams of geists.

## Ascension to Undeath

A unique aspect of service in [The Usurper's Bane]({{ site.baseurl }}/The%20Usurper%27s%20Bane) is that death is not always the end. Many fodders who fall in battle are reanimated as zombified thralls, continuing their service beyond the grave.
