**Type**: Human

In the universe of Andrzej Sapkowski's _The Witcher_, **Vatt'ghern **is the term for "witcher" in Elder Speech (_Hen Llinge_). 

The ancient language is primarily spoken by elves, mages, and scholars from the Nilfgaardian Empire, whose dialect is heavily derived from Elder Speech.

### Characteristics

A Vatt'ghern is not merely a warrior, but a specialized professional operating under a specific code of honor in a dark fantasy setting. 

**Mutant Physiology**: Due to undergoing the "Trial of the Grasses" as children, they possess inhumanly acute senses (smell, sight, hearing), enabling them to track prey effortlessly.

**Superhuman Attributes**: They possess exceptional strength, speed, reflexes, and endurance, allowing them to defeat monsters single-handedly.

**High Resilience**: They have a drastically increased pain tolerance, accelerated healing, and high resistance to disease.

**Alchemical Dependency**: Their metabolism allows them to consume mutagenic, highly toxic potions and oils that would kill a normal human.

**Sterility**: A permanent, common result of the mutations, which contributes to their isolated, nomadic lifestyle.

**Extended Lifespan**: They age significantly slower than regular humans. 

### Personality and Lifestyle

**"Walking the Path"**: They are nomadic mercenaries, traveling from town to town to hunt creatures for money.

**Emotion Control**: While often perceived as emotionless due to intense mental conditioning, they are capable of feeling emotions but are trained to control them.

**Reluctant Neutrality**: They typically try to avoid political, moral, or social conflicts, focusing strictly on their contracts, though they often get involved to protect friends.

**Shunned Status**: Despite protecting humans, they are often seen as repulsive mutants and outcasts.
