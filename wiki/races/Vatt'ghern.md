Vatt'ghern, also known as Witchers, are humans who have undergone extensive physical and mental conditioning and mysterious alchemical mutations.

## The Transformation

The centerpiece of becoming a Vatt'ghern is the **[Trial of the Grasses]({{ site.baseurl }}/Trial%20of%20the%20Grasses)**, a dangerous procedure involving the ingestion of specialized mutagens. Those who survive emerge with inhuman strength, reflexes, and senses. In the Usurper's Bane campaign, these mutations are often "Abyssal-stained," drawing power from the dark magic of the Great Raven.

## Characteristics

* **Yellow Slitted Eyes**: A hallmark of their predatory nature, granting superior vision in darkness.
* **Predatory Grace**: Unnatural speed and coordination that turns swordfighting into a mathematical certainty.
* **Resistance**: Enhanced resilience to poisons and toxins.
