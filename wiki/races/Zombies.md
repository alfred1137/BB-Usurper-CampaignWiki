Zombies are slower and clumsier than humans, and easy to hit. But their high HP, ability to rise again from the dead and sheer numbers make them hard to kill. Those who fight them can easily exhaust themselves, and will be only able to use a basic attack once, like Zombies they fight. Zombies inflict extra fatigue with their attacks to make it happen sooner.



Their melee skill is low, and they compensate it with Backstabber, that works well because they are outnumbering their enemy.



They have special units: Geists who can scream, trying to scare you, and Necromancers who rise the dead to fight again and empower them to break your defenses.



If a human dies to them, he becomes one of them. Necromancers can resurrect dead humans, and during the Undead Scourge they can rise on their own.



# Description


## Necromancer

Everybody knows of magic and wizards, dark arts and the like. The Necromancer is just that; a wizard who decided selfish and evil acts suited them more. Wherever you're likely to run into zombies, they'll most likely be serving a master who'll quite gladly raise them over and over again into undeath. And should one of your brothers fall, the Necromancer will take glee in his resurrection...



## Geist

Geist (german for spirit/ghost) can make quick work of their enemys resolve and always deal damage to HP rendering armor useless against them. A good Sergeant is very helpful against them.


# Zombified Mercenaries

In the service of [The Usurper's Bane]({{ site.baseurl }}/The%20Usurper%27s%20Bane), death is not always the end. Through the Abyssal arts of [HiYun]({{ site.baseurl }}/HiYun) or the lingering effects of the **Chaos Plague**, fallen brothers are sometimes reanimated as zombified thralls. These unliving warriors serve as tireless anchors for the company's frontline, absorbing punishment that would destroy the living.

Notable zombified members include:
* **[Arnulf]({{ site.baseurl }}/Arnulf)**: Known as the "Walking Miracle," he served for weeks as a silent shield.
* **Theudebald**: A vagabond who transitioned into a Wiederganger after a battle with geists.
* **[Muyahid]({{ site.baseurl }}/Muyahid)**: A shepherd who became a zombie after being cleaved by an orc.
