Champions are particularly skilled and experienced individuals who stand head and shoulders above their brethren. In the Usurper's Bane campaign, several legendary figures have crossed paths with the company.

## Notable Champions

### Bakh Lob the Boil Burster
An Orc Berserker Champion encountered in the northern foothills. He was a force of pure, chaotic violence, wielding massive axes and shrugging off wounds that would fell a normal man. He was eventually brought down by the company at the cost of two original fodder members.

### Borealis the Primal
A legendary juggernaut clad in over 1,000 durability points of frost-rimed plate armor. He rampaged near Wolkenburg before being systematically executed by the combined magic and steel of The Usurper's Bane.

### "King of the North"
A self-proclaimed monarch of the wastes who faced the company in multiple rematches. Clad in trophies and arrogance, he was eventually dismantled by the company's elite core.

### Bakh Lob the Boil Burster
A Champion Orc Berserker who led a band of brigands. He was a terrifying foe who required the combined efforts of the company to defeat.

## Rewards of Victory

Prevailing against a champion always rewards the company with a **Named Item** (Famed gear)—be it a weapon, shield, armor, or helmet. These artifacts are vital for the company's survival against the rising tide of the Usurper's influence.
