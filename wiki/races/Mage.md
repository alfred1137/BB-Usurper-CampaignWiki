Mages are individuals who have unlocked the ability to manipulate the fundamental energies of the world. In the Usurper's Bane campaign, these powers often stem from the Abyss.

## Abyssal Magic

Practitioners like [HiYun]({{ site.baseurl }}/HiYun) draw their power from the void, guided by the influence of [The Changer]({{ site.baseurl }}/Changer). This magic is often destructive and transformative, capable of shocking enemies through heavy armor or reanimating the fallen as mindless shells.

## Characteristics

* **Arcane Visage**: Powerful magic often leaves a physical mark on its wielder, such as [HiYun]({{ site.baseurl }}/HiYun)'s green face.
* **Mastery of the Void**: The ability to channel "Twisted Shock" and other Abyssal energies.
* **Ritual Study**: The constant pursuit of knowledge through the autopsy of supernatural creatures and the decoding of ancient tomes.
